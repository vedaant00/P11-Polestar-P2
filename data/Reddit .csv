"I used to love tesla. I was invested in it for many years and had a model Y ready for delivery. I cancelled it.

How is a comparison valid when the Polestar 4 has so many more features and quality? Model Y doesn't have:

\- Parking sensors

\- Radar

\- turning stalks - terrible idea to remove it!

\- HUD display

\- interior lighting

\- shaded roof

\- ventilated seats

\- massage seats

\- reclining back seats

\- a lot more space

\- Google maps

\- 80% chance the build quality will also be superior to Teslas...

"Not really. You need to compare the European price - the prices of the Polestar 4 above are in Euro:

"Ultimately based on me sitting in both for many hours. 

A lot of what people feel is premium re look and feel is obv going to be subjective.

Objectively though-

No leather seats,
No pano roof,
No rear heated seats,
No ACC/ pilot assist,
Only a reverse cam


Subjectively, despite loving Volvos (Ive had 5 in the last 8 years) and having a big turn off to Tesla as a brand, having spent hours and hours in both - base vs base, Id be buying a Tesla 3 long before a Polestar 2 (esp at current prices / incentives)",2023-11-02 15:42:58,"Polestar 4 prices revealed: $26,800 cheaper than Polestar 3 - ArenaEV

"Until 2024 models, the P2 came with almost nothing as standard. No ACC, no blindspot monitoring, no active lane keeping, FWD vs. RWD, much slower, worse range, etc. 

Even with 24 Models, the 2 is quite a bad deal vs. other available EVs. Its slower, slower charging, has the worst cloth seats while leather is an extremely overpriced upgrade. It has no power operated steering wheel, the upgrade H/K stereo is terrible, efficiency isnt nearly as high as Model 3, Ioniq 6 or even BMW i4, it has less interior room, much worse resale values, etc. The P2 is a fine bargain rental car, but with a few options the pricing gets ridiculous. The Performance upgrade doesnt do much of anything to transform the experience behind the wheel other than make range and ride quality worse. Theres very little difference in power output. For similar money the BMW i4 M50 is a much nicer and more enjoyable vehicle to drive with a bigger interior, better ride quality, sharper dynamics, faster charging, etc. For $15-20K less than a loaded P2 w/Performance upgrade you can get a Model 3 Performance that will leave it in the dust and offers a far more balanced chassis than the 2s converted FWD ICE platform. 

Polestar has got to really look at what theyre doing. The P3 has less luggage volume than a Kia EV6, less headroom than a Y, less rear seat space than an EV6, is slower than the LR AWD Y and X and EV6, yet its priced higher than a Model X LR AWD and with a couple options like leather its at Model X Plaid pricing. I dont know who is going to pay $85,000-$105,000 for the 3 after they experience it in person. I was thoroughly disappointed when I went to a local Polestar space and sat in it. The interior is cheaply made and bland. Poor use of space. 111kWh battery only offering up 270 miles of range is terrible. The upcoming Audi Q6 e-tron and Porsche Macan EV will offer substantially more range from a smaller battery, much higher performance and the interiors dont look and feel cheap. The Audi and Porsche are also going to be 800V with 270kW charging. The 3 is at least $25,000 overpriced. Polestar is pricing it against a BMW iX, Mercedes EQE500 (and even the lower trim levels of the EQS SUV), yet theyre offering a vehicle thats got less room inside than an XC40 (Polestar 3 has 440 L of luggage space vs. 460 L in the XC40). How they managed to take what was an EX90 3-row SUV and turn it into a cramped 5-seater is a mystery to me. Given how much less room it has, you wouldve hoped the efficiency and performance would be much better, but the 4.6-5.0s 0-60mph time is pitiful, even against the much cheaper P2 and range is no better than the EX90. Its a big fail in my book.",2023-12-01 15:43:22,"Polestar 4 prices revealed: $26,800 cheaper than Polestar 3 - ArenaEV

"You're confusing ""premium"" with ""well equipped."" (Let's call it BigMac on a porcelain plate eaten with silver flatware vs. a Wagyu cut in a pita bread.)

The most expensive 911s are completely stripped down (A/C and even rolling windows) and for the price, a Mazda3 would be infinitely more equipped than a ""comparable"" Volvo. (I'll leave the Volvo vs. Polestar comparison, as they are actually the same car).

If what matters to you are the *options*, then go for it man. And yes, positioning may be completely arbitrary, and certainly subjective. But some ""subjective"" measures you're referring to are *actually* objective and what make the PS2 premium vs. the Tesla3. The former is a quality car, the latter is a tin can with a great computer. The quality and materials, not to mention craftsmanship (have you ever taken a good look at panel gaps in the Tesla3?) are miles apart. AlsoI assume you're in the StatesTeslas are inherently priced lower as American-made. The PS3 will be assembled in the US but the rest are all imports, so another place where a comparison is not exactly 1:1.

"deciding get a model 3 or the polestar 2 came down to the hatchback and fit & finish.  We got the polestar 2 and couldn't be happier.  I'm sure the ex30 is fine, but our carseat would not fit in those back seats.  Also, where are you getting that the ex30 is more comfortable for passengers?  Kris Rifa does a direct comparison to the polestar 2 and says it's not.  Look, the EX30 will be perfect for city dwellers who are single and don't have to cart around their friends all the time.

"Its a fair point, I just wouldnt consider a car slightly premium without these functions

I also forgot to include electrically reclining seats. I was genuinely astounded to realise the base Polestar did not have these

The base Polestar felt cheap to me, well built, solid but cheap inside (mainly by the seats to be fair)

Cheaper than a Tesla, hmmm pluses and minuses

The seats?  Theyve got to go, no more comfy than Tesla, cheap cloth, limited electrification. No thanks. They alone are enough for me to choose the Tesla. I LOVE Volvos leather seats

Steering Wheel? Big win for the Polestar, look and feelwise, functionality on par

Back seat feel. Big win for the Tesla with the roof and seemingly miles more room. Im sorry but sitting in the back of a base Polestar is not a nice place to be

General marerials, headliner etc I personally feel little difference, slight nod to the Polestar maybe but its not Premium, its mid. Like the Tesla

Dont get me wrong, I like the Polestar, theres no level whatsoever where I would ever describe the base one as being more premium in any way to make you buy it at a price premium over the Tesla.

As a base car, the Tesla is a much better proposition in regards to premium feel (for me at least, simply due to the roof, seats and Pilot Assist.

"I have both. And I'm going to be unbiased about it. 

The polestar is great in the corners. But not that the y can't,  but the polestar has better turning in the corners.  But all proper electric cars are great in corners because they're bottom heavy. 

Performance,  eh? Polestar plays it too safe unless you take it off abs. Tesla is like shooting an old 12 gauge,  it gives you every inch of punch.  Overall,  the performance ps2 all wheel drives is as strong as a MYLR with performance boost. 

Technology,  well.... pretend that the tesla software is a senior developer at a cutting edge of technology firm.  Ps2 is the preschooler eating chalk.  The computer is slow.  The ui is clumsy and terribly organized.  Tons tons of bugs.  But,  it does use a bigger app store... but tesla is planning something later. And don't get me started on the phone app!

Cameras and safety, ps2 has weird down cameras that help in tight corners which is cool.... but the tesla wins in this.  They have side cameras that help on free way driving like crazy good.  Ps2 uses a fish lens for back up camera which is.... awful.  

Paint.  Used to be a detailer,  the model y loses.  Period. Everyone usually gets ppf to protect the whole car on model y because it chips very easily.  But there's a huge market for full body ppfs because if it.

Charging .  .... model y 

Coolness, I refuse to mount the front license plate on the ps2. It's black and that look on the front.... omg.... it's amazing. 

Interior,  both win and lose.  Ps2 textured interior is a pain to clean,  easy on the y. But the y does feel cheap. The ps2 is much smaller on the inside, almost uncomfortable. Smaller boot too. And frunk. 

Overall, I love both cars.  Ps2 is classy af and great for the single person.... but I'm not.  Family of 4 with hockey road trips and long commute to work. The model y is cheaper and far better for families. The room in it makes me comfortable and has literally saved my life on the road.

"Never driven the Y but am coming up on 27K miles on my Polestar 2 in just over a year and a half. I have however driven numerous Model 3's that I've rented (thanks, Turo!) while on business trips so I consider that a point of comparison.

Interior of the P\*2 is smaller than the 3, but feels more ""cockpit-like"". I'm 5'11"" and 185lbs so pretty darned average (\~180cm / 84Kg) and I fit wonderfully. The car has never felt small to me but I definitely agree the Tesla has a cavernous interior. The Y has a larger interior still so if you desperately need loads of space then the Y is your best bet. However, having said that I've had 4 people in my car for \~100 mile drives and 3 people plus luggage for \~600 mile drives and we've been comfortable and happy on all of them so YMMV. Trunk is roomy but not massive, but the hatchback makes it supremely usable; just two weeks ago I was hauling around a couple of [Peavey PR15's](https://assets.peavey.com/literature/specs/116440_13932.pdf) with associated stands and a portable Eurorack setup containing mixing desk and stuff and I still had room to spare.

The car itself is a nice size for using around the city in general... not a small city car by any means but small enough that it'll fit happily in any parking spaces you care to look for. Parallel parking this thing is a cinch because it has great steering and visibility is actually pretty good... the cameras help as well if you need them. Visibility in the rear view mirror isn't fantastic but it's good enough to see what's behind you which is all you really need. It's also fast and comfortable and I've had a great time driving it and have zero intention of getting rid of it.

Subjectively I think the Polestar 2 is a really handsome vehicle. The interior has just the right amount of minimalism and flair and feels premium and well put together. The interior of the Model 3/Y is stark and uninspiring and I just don't find it a good place to spend time. The sound system in the Polestar is light years better than the Tesla in my opinion... the Model 3 has more bass but the Polestar's Harmon Kardon (not the base) system has much better definition... and I've always had that sense of feedback from audio reflections inside the Model 3 that make my listening subpar. In fairness, the Model 3 has a LOT of glass inside and it's really tough to dial out those audio reflections... despite the glass roof the amount of reflective surface inside the Polestar is nowhere close. I find the Model 3 to be ugly and the Model Y catastrophically ugly from the outside... but I get that's fully subjective. After so long without a refresh too the appearance of the Tesla is getting really long in the tooth and boring... but given their focus on efficiency over all else I don't see the appearance changing anytime soon.

They're both good cars, but I would cross-shop the P\*2 against the 3, not the Y. The Y is absolutely more practical because of the interior space and if you can get past the negatives of the Tesla then it's the better car. For my part though I wanted a Model 3 until I actually saw one... but I still was cautious and decided to try it before I bought it and found it underwhelming to the point that I just couldn't see myself happy in it at all. The Polestar 2 has so far been a reliable, safe but still fun car to drive and I look forward to many more years with it.

Oh and people have mentioned the tech; I find the tech in the Polestar 2 to be just fine. I've never found it slow except the first couple of minutes after startup but even then it's fast enough for what I need it for. I had a couple of TCAM issues early on but software updates have fixed that from what I can see. The only issue I have with the software is that some apps are somewhat half-assed in their functionality and operation and occasionally bugs creep in; unlike Tesla where the entire stack is integrated the Polestar has an Android OS and a bunch of third-party apps where the integration and optimization can be a mixed bag. However having said that there's enough of these and similar cars running AAOS now with similar hardware that the apps are continually improving.",2023-07-02 12:33:21,"Honest Polestar 2 Ownership Experience?

That said, I could see taller people maybe feeling cramped.

Tesla totally loses on finish quality though. Unless you're getting a 3 or X, Teslas are chintzy. The PS2 feels like a solid car and, IMO, has just the right # of buttons and levers. 

I also like the infotainment system being integrated with Google. I'm not hard to please here, I'm old and *like* tech but don't *love* tech - you know what I mean?

We loved it so much we bought a BST as well. That car is even quieter, handles noticeably better, and is quicker. We dont have the Performance Pack on the first, but I dont need it for the daily driver. 

The Y was the other car we considered. It felt quicker. The car I test drove had some serious wind noise and the body panels didnt align perfectly. Thats how we ended up with the Polestar. Several acquaintances have Ys and LOVE them. I dont think you can go wrong with either car.

1 - The camera for backing up almost always glitches, which is super annoying.

2 - My key FOB VERY regulary is not connecting/not recognized. So I am constantly having to jiggle my purse, open the door via the actual button, etc. I will also get the error that the key is not in the vehicle when it is (jiggle the purse again... then take out the keys and push a button).

5 - Sometimes the audio just stops working. Even for the turn blinker. You have to restart the computer system and then it will work. I found this out after a year, which was super annoying.

"I offer a slightly different take. 

The model Y has definitely more interior and cargo space, the better app, and probably less laggy infotainment. 

But our Polestars have been totally fine hauling our family (2 adults, 2 kids) around not just locally but on car trips all around California. Our kids activities gear fit in the trunk fine. The only time its been tight has been when also hauling around grandma on a week long road trip and had 5 people stuff including the then younger kids varied crap and large car seat - and it was still fine, just tighter. 

While the Tesla infotainment is probably smoother, I like Polestars implementation of Spotify and Maps way better than the analogous things on Tesla. And the kids love asking Hey Google random trivia like how big/fast was a megalodon.

"Not surprising. The rash of negative press in such a short period of time felt intentional. Volvo either wanted the entire IP to themselves at a discount or wanted to wash their hands of it.

Once you posted about it, I went and looked around at the corporate structure between the two sides and the tension probably stems from philosophical differences between ex-Volvo (and current Polestar leadership) and new Volvo. For example, current Volvo CEO Jim Rowan is not a car guy - hes a C-suite from BlackBerry and Dyson. A money manager and probably a logistics man. Previous Volvo CEO Hakan Samuelson is an engineer and car enthusiast who oversaw the purchase of the Polestar branding and engineering division and spun it out into the dedicated EV company. He also happens to be the current Polestar Chairman next to current Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath (ex-Volvo head of design). What I speculate is that Polestar probably wants to be the electric enthusiast vehicle of the future - maybe even at the detriment of profits - and Volvo leadership doesnt care about that mission and just wants to sell more cars.

"The other weird thing with the ex30 is that its priced at nearly 54k cad for the base model, which is within a few hundred dollars of the base polestar 2. They qualify for the same incentives so its really a hard sell unless Canadians really like subcompact but higher riding CUVs? We have a PS2 FWD and was thinking about replacing our aging Leaf and considered the ex30 but at this point another PS2 would make more sense we even went to a sign-up only event to see the ex30 in person last year, and the interior is even more pared down compared to the minimalist PS2 design and borderlines cheap/tacky.

The actual US pricing of $35k USD ($46k cad) does make the ex30 more compelling though if that was an option up north but for some reason Volvo decided either the market is too small here to care or wed just cough up the higher price just for the Volvo brand?",2024-02-02 02:27:15,"Volvo to stop funding Polestar, handing stakes to Geely

"It hits a lot of notes well.

I might not be a car enthusiast but its still fun to drive. Sure, Porsche might be more fun (?), but Polestar hits my threshold for fun-ness. Similarly, it has enough range and charging speed where I look for other tiebreakers.

I also appreciate the focus on sustainability - you need to pay more for a vegan interior with Porsche! - and their attempts at transparency on emissions and sourcing.

The cars look really good; theres no comparable vehicle to any Polestar that I think looks better than the Polestar equivalent.

The UI is clean, with just enough buttons. Android Automotive is better than any OEM infotainment thats not Tesla or Rivian. Maps in the dashboard is awesome.

Cant read German but something destroyed the door trims,2023-09-28 02:49:36,"Dude, Why's My Polestar 2 On Fire?




It's always interesting to come out of the Walmart you're charging at to see fire and smoke coming from your car! My initial, uninformed opinion is that a wire shorted and started melting the plastic around it. Got it towed off last night to the nearest Polestar service center (in Charlotte). What a fun thing to happen on a roadtrip after two years!

Fun fact: Polestar considers fires an accident and so an insurance problem, they will not tow the car for you.

Developing situation today as everyone opens and I figure out my life. I imagine there'll be a fight between Polestar, Progressive, and Electrify America. Had it for nearly two years, done multiple roadtrips (two cross country) and has around 22k miles on it. Loved the car and the response to this situation will determine if the Polestar 2 is still an option when my lease is up next year (or depending on whatever the heck goes on with this car).

We won't know for sure until we can compare verified measurements, but I do think the Polestar 3 offers more room, so it's not a fair comparison.

# Polestars New Electric Car Has No Rear Window

Polestar is a design-driven, pure-electric brand, so the arrival of the Polestar 4 is no surprise (especially, coming as it does, after Polestars 1, 2, and 3). But what is thought-provoking is that this savvy brand of lateral thinkers and style mavens wants to rescue one of the more egregious automotive nichesthe SUV coup.

It helps that the companys CEO, Thomas Ingenlath, was a designer in a former life. Rather than simply modifying an existing SUV, giving it a faster roofline, and as a result compromising elements like rear headroom and comfort, we have designed Polestar 4 from the ground up as a new breed of SUV coup that celebrates rear occupant comfort, he claims.

So while the most powerful dual-motor Polestar 4 runs a 102-kWh battery for a claimed range of 350 miles (WLTP), and is the most high-performance Polestar to date, all eyes are understandably on the cars designand the rear end in particular. Why? Because Polestar has got rid of the traditional rear window entirely.

**Those in Glass Houses**

Polestar 4 EV on black backdrop

Photograph: Polestar

Its an idea the company explored with its gorgeous 2020 Precept concept car, but here it is for real. Given that the shape of a cars glasshouse, as designers refer to it, is core to how we read a vehicle, eliminating one major section of it is a punchy statement.

Polestar has done it by embracing the capabilities of the high-definition screen that replaces the age-old rear-view mirror. This displays a real-time feed from a roof-mounted rear camera, and delivers a much broader field of vision. These arent newRange Rover has been using its ClearSight camera mirror for yearsbut Polestar is the first to max out on the design potential.

The reason? In elongating the Polestar 4s silhouette, the cars aerodynamic properties have also been optimized, a key part of an EVs range-extending armory. The 4 has an impressively slippery 0.26 drag coefficient. But it also enables a reimagining of the cars rear compartment.

In the past, weve always had to provide an opening at the rear for a physical mirror, Polestars head of design, Maximilian Missoni, tells WIRED. Camera tech now is very high resolution, it works well at night time, and the software is constantly being upgraded so we can add value into the system over time. We could remove the rear window and move the whole structure further back. It creates a cocoon.

Ingenlath and Missoni are one of the car industrys most formidable design double acts, having proven themselves at Volkswagen and Volvo. Some car bosses are tone-deaf when it comes to design, and Missoni admits that Ingenlaths intimate knowledge of the territory is helpful. But he insists that the Polestar 4 is as much the product of pragmatic thinking as it is conceptual design theorizing.

**Aerodynamic Advantage**

Rear view of the Polestar 4 EV on black backdrop

Photograph: Polestar

The cars development has been driven by the availability of technology, but it also improves aerodynamics, and it improves the roominess of the interior, Missoni says. On an SUV coup, these are often in conflict. You aim to get a sleek silhouette, otherwise whats the point? But then interior space is compromised. This shape frees up all the constituents because of the use of technology.

There are some old-school solutions that weve learned to live with, he says. But as a designer and engineer, its obviously good to say, Do we have the technologies now that could compete with this? Usually the answer is, Yes, but theyre not quite as good, so lets forget about it. But if you use digital technology, like a camera and the accompanying software, there are more features you can add. The extrapolation of these things gives you so much potential.

Although the deletion of the back window risks a certain claustrophobia, the 4s rear compartment seemingly manages to envelope occupants without plunging them into existential gloom. Several things help here. Firstly, a full-length glass roof is standard, with the option of an electrochromic function to switch between opaque or transparent. Crucially, the glass roof stretches back and beyond the rear occupants heads, and finishes part of the way into the area in which a traditional rear window would sit.

Missoni and his team have also doubled down on the cocoon effect by angling the exterior belt-line up on the rear doors. This is a very striking car, with some hard""robotic,"" says Missonisurface treatments blending with softer forms. Importantly, the Polestars 3 and 4 are fully differentiated, and the new car sits between the 2 and 3 in the hierarchy.

**Extra Interior**

Interior view of the Polestar 4 EV

Photograph: Polestar

Then theres the interior. The 4 uses what Missoni loftily calls soft tech, inspired by sportswear and featuring new treatments for Polestar. Theres a tailored 3D-knit textile, which consists of 100 percent recycled PET (a form of polyester), codeveloped with the Swedish School of Textiles; bio-attributed MicroTech vinyl, which replaces crude oil with pine oil; and ethically sourced Nappa leather.

The rear headrests are bigger than usual because theres no need to worry about them obscuring the view behind. Front or back, this is an interior that potentially manages to be stimulating yet calm at the same time.

Polestars relationship with Google continues, and again encompasses built-in Google Assistant, Google Maps, and Google Play, while the infotainment system is powered by the Android Automotive OS. A 15.4-inch, landscape-oriented screen (no spinning tablets here) is the main focus of an otherwise minimalist cockpit. Missoni reckons the Polestar 4 has a warmer ambience than the 2 or 3, with an interior lighting setup supposedly inspired by the solar system.

**Vehicle-to-Load Capability**

Performance is impressive, if not quite intergalactic. Dual- and single-motor versions will be available, the long-range dual motor benefitting from a 544-bhp power output, for a 0 to 62 mph time of 3.8 seconds. That iteration also allows the driver to choose between performance or range modes, and it uses semi-active suspension to sharpen its dynamics.

The long-range single motor car has 272 bhp and a claimed range of 372 miles (WLTP). The Polestar 4 can also be specified with 22-inch wheels, the biggest fitted to a Polestar so far. Bidirectional charging is included, and there is vehicle-to-load capability. Up to 200-kW DC and 22-kW AC charging is included on all versions.

Interestingly, the 4 uses parent company Geelys Sustainable Experience Architecture (SEA), an open source modular platform that also underpins the Zeekr 001, the companys new all-electric brand. (It will also be used by the upcoming Smart electric SUV, as part of Mercedess joint venture with Geely.) The Polestar 3, meanwhile, uses the Volvo SPA 2 platform thats also the basis for the new fully electric EX90.

Production begins at Geelys Hangzhou Bay plant in China in November this year, although the Polestar 4 will also be manufactured at Volvos Ridgeville plant in South Carolina, ahead of a 2024 launch in Europe. Expect prices to start at around 55,000 ($68,283).",2023-04-17 19:42:00,"Here is the brand new Polestar 4

I contacted polestar about this very issue - lack of light and more worryingly lack of air circulation . Firstly theres a pet mode for the air con. And  theres a vertical parcel shelf between the trunk and the main cabin. It can be folded down and it looks like it gives about 6 inches of daylight into the trunk.

I don't think it's even a fully equivalent trim the 2022 PS2 I found was missing some of the smaller features like the vegan leather and other small optional stuff compared to the 2024. The lease cost is 19k over 27 months than just below 32k residual. That's including the EV tax credits for new car and New jerseys ev sales tax exemption. The depreciation of Polestars also helps a lot. In total it's just shy of 51k over 27 months vs the financing on the optimistic end for me with the 2022 being 42k. That depends if I'm able to actually meet my aggressive payment plan towards the principal. It could be more because my interest rate wouldn't be great.

Polestar 4 has just been released and will be in Europe and Australia by August. What I wanna say is there are many interesting things I noticed when digging into their spec sheet. We somehow could get the following features if polestar is willing to via OTA updates: (see images for details)

- Animal mode / climate mode
From my understanding, in our polestar 2, we would have to sit on the driver seat, buckle the seat belts, or press whatever buttons on our phone just to have 30mins of climate. I really hope polestar can implement this via OTA update

- Auto-lane change
Polestar 2 has a side camera and radar. The hardware is here. Not saying that I will use it, but it will be cool to have it via OTA update

- Dash cam
The Dashcam app uses a camera in the overhead console to capture the road ahead while driving. It can film and store footage manually or be set to record automatically if the cars safety systems detect a possible collision.
I cant see why polestar 2 didnt get that. OTA update PLEASE.

"> What hardware limitations does it have? 

See u/AlphaLemur47 response. tl;dr the electronics of the car need to be built for it from the start. If it's not you run into all sorts of problems. On top of that, just the software development effort it would take is way out of Polestars budget and interest. Better to wait and release it with the next gen PS2 or its successor.

> Isnt even a bad camera enough to record footages? 

No not really. Best case you'll get a poor resolution, super fish eyed view. Not to mention the positioning of the cameras. They're positioned to frame the car and what's right next to it, not the road around you. So it'll not capture anything of value, like reg plates, signs, the other driver etc. Things that are important to the insurance company.

Launching a poor quality built in dash cam system, that'll most likely not capture anything of value, is gonna put a hefty dent in their reputation as a premium brand, since the competition would be so much better. If you need a dashcam, it's better to spend the extra cash for a fitcamx or something else that integrates nicely into the look and interior of the car.",2024-01-31 17:41:50,"Polestar 2 potential updates

There was someone on r/volvo who took their bumper off to show damage and it showed the radar panels, can't find the post anymore. But anyway, they are placed in the rear bumper, one on each side.

These radars are present whether you have pilot pack or not. Even if you don't have BLIS they are still used to steer you back if you are cutting someone off. And they are also used for CTA. They are not used for parking distance measuring, however.

"I wanted to get this car. I find the starting price ok, but the base long range is so slow lol. 7+ seconds for a 65 thousand euro vehicle is pretty ridiculous.

So then we're already looking at 73k. Which I guess is OK for what you get, still very expensive. However I was really looking forward to having ventilated seats (only option I'd want extra) and suddenly you're looking at 85 thousand euros!!!

I've had my Polestar 2 for 6 months and I love it. That said, a few things bother me that seem like easy fixes. I'm posting my review to get it off my chest and in the slight hope someone from Polestar will see this and fix them.  


**The Good:**  
Driving experience:  
Best in class. I test drove a lot of cars when making my purchasing decision, and the Polestar is the most fun I drove. It matched cars that cost three times what a Polestar does. Incredibly good.

Design:  
Let's just say it, a Polestar looks better than a Tesla. It looks incredible inside and out. There are other cars that looks as cool, but I'm not sure there are many that look better. 

Safety:  
There have been times when Polestar's collision avoidance potentially kept me from getting in an accident. I like that it automatically detects obstacles and prevents you from hitting them. A few things could be improved - adaptive cruise control can't see cars merging into your lane, for instance. But overall quite good.

These are the most important features of a car, so I'm overall quite pleased with my purchase. But there are some design decisions that leave me scratching my head, too.

**The bad:**  
Low ceiling:   
I'm 6'3"", and I can't sit up straight in the backseat. I crack my neck a lot and I can't do that even in the front seat without hitting the ceiling. It also reduces visibility. 

Climate control:   
Just give me buttons and dials that say ""hot"" on one end and ""cold"" on the other. I don't want to set a specific temperature on the screen - I can feel how hot or cold the air coming out is, and it's annoying to have to look away from the road and at the screen to set temperature. 

Center console:  
It's cool that there are side pockets and a deep center pocket, but I need two cupholders and a flat center pocket like everyone else gives me. 

Music:  
I do not understand why the car assumes I want the music to stop when I stand up. I never fucking want the music to stop. If I'm pregaming outside a venue, I want my music to keep playing, just like it did on my cheap as fuck 2016 Nissan Leaf. And Spotify is so hopelessly broken I had to uninstall it from the car, because not only does Spotify not work - if it's even open on my phone it will stop all sound from any app in the vehicle, as long as the app is also installed in the car. This makes no sense.

I can deal with these minor inconveniences - but then there are a few things about the car that make no fucking sense whatsoever. I have to assume the engineers who made these decisions have never driven a car before, or at least haven't since 1963. 

**The ugly:**  
Cruise control:  
It's very cool that you can switch between regular cruise control and assisted. What isn't cool is that the assisted control will sometimes hallucinate that a car is in your lane and slam on the breaks unceremoniously, or slam on the breaks instead of gradually slowing down when there's a car in front of you. It also can't see cars merging into the lane and can't see stoplights, red lights, or when a car is leaving the lane. Some of these seem pretty basic! And it's annoying that to switch between regular cruise control and assisted, you have to turn of cruise control and go FOUR CLICKS DEEP in the screen menu. What the fuck Volvo! Just make that weird left button that does nothing turn assist off and on.

Cameras:  
I didn't even think to ask when I bought the car if the cameras stored video. Tesla has done this for I think a decade, and it's an extremely obvious feature for both accidents and breakins. But not only do they not, there isn't even the capability to add this in the future. I hope letting thieves getting away with breaking into my car was worth the $31.42 it saved Volvo to not add a tiny chip that stores video. 

Seat recline (or lack thereof):  
Has no one at Volvo ever taken a nap in the car before, leaned back and listened to music, or gotten road head? Why did they decide that no one should be able to recline their seat more than 10 degrees, and to do even that they have to crank this awful-ass wheel extremely slowly? I have to assume these engineers are all virgins who have never seen a car with lever recline before.   
When I complained to the dealership about this, they proudly said ""Volvos have had the wheel since 1963"" or some shit. What. The. Fuck. You mean to tell me it's been this broken since 1963 and no one has fixed it???

A few other things that bother me - making a call covers the map in the HUD, there's no option for aerowheels to extend range, and the app doesn't work unless you have both keys (and since I bought mine used, I only have one). Most of these things are easy fixes, so I hope someone at Polestar sees this and makes some updates.

"You can easily use Google to control the temperature if you dont like the screen.  You can turn on seat heaters, steering wheel heaters, get navigation going, you can choose the music you want to listen to all without taking your eyes off the road.  

When I test drove one I found it very cramped. My son who is 65 was not impressed with the front legroom at all.  My 2010 Kia forte koup had better legroom to be honest

I havent tried Spotify but YouTube Music works really well on android automotive. 

I believe the last update shouldve given you the ability to switch between regular and adaptive cruise using the left/right buttons on the left control cluster on your steering wheel.  I say this assuming that the updates that Polestar and Volvo get are very similar.

I didnt think that the polestar seats stood up very well against Volvo seats. They kinda look the same but they didnt feel as good. 

Turning a wheel to recline? Base model?  

I enjoyed my test drive but it was just too cramped and honestly not big enough for my needs.  Im just gonna wait for my Volvo EV wagon.

A final thought, dont be afraid of the voice control its pretty good.  I use AAOS for navigation and music and I use CarPlay for text and telephony. We all hate change but when its out of our control it makes a lot more sense to roll with it and learn how to use it.  If I can do it at 61, all of you sweet young things should be able to manage",2023-10-22 03:08:08,"Polestar Review

Why did they decide that no one should be able to recline their seat more than 10 degrees, and to do even that they have to crank this awful-ass wheel extremely slowly? I have to assume these engineers are all virgins who have never seen a car with lever recline before.   
When I complained to the dealership about this, they proudly said ""Volvos have had the wheel since 1963"" or some shit. What. The. Fuck. You mean to tell me it's been this broken since 1963 and no one has fixed it???

A few other things that bother me - making a call covers the map in the HUD, there's no option for aerowheels to extend range, and the app doesn't work unless you have both keys (and since I bought mine used, I only have one). Most of these things are easy fixes, so I hope someone at Polestar sees this and makes some updates.

I've had my Polestar 2 for 6 months and I love it. That said, a few things bother me that seem like easy fixes. I'm posting my review to get it off my chest and in the slight hope someone from Polestar will see this and fix them.  


**The Good:**  
Driving experience:  
Best in class. I test drove a lot of cars when making my purchasing decision, and the Polestar is the most fun I drove. It matched cars that cost three times what a Polestar does. Incredibly good.

Design:  
Let's just say it, a Polestar looks better than a Tesla. It looks incredible inside and out. There are other cars that looks as cool, but I'm not sure there are many that look better. 

Safety:  
There have been times when Polestar's collision avoidance potentially kept me from getting in an accident. I like that it automatically detects obstacles and prevents you from hitting them. A few things could be improved - adaptive cruise control can't see cars merging into your lane, for instance. But overall quite good.

These are the most important features of a car, so I'm overall quite pleased with my purchase. But there are some design decisions that leave me scratching my head, too.

**The bad:**  
Low ceiling:   
I'm 6'3"", and I can't sit up straight in the backseat. I crack my neck a lot and I can't do that even in the front seat without hitting the ceiling. It also reduces visibility. 

Climate control:   
Just give me buttons and dials that say ""hot"" on one end and ""cold"" on the other. I don't want to set a specific temperature on the screen - I can feel how hot or cold the air coming out is, and it's annoying to have to look away from the road and at the screen to set temperature. 

Center console:  
It's cool that there are side pockets and a deep center pocket, but I need two cupholders and a flat center pocket like everyone else gives me. 

Music:  
I do not understand why the car assumes I want the music to stop when I stand up. I never fucking want the music to stop. If I'm pregaming outside a venue, I want my music to keep playing, just like it did on my cheap as fuck 2016 Nissan Leaf. And Spotify is so hopelessly broken I had to uninstall it from the car, because not only does Spotify not work - if it's even open on my phone it will stop all sound from any app in the vehicle, as long as the app is also installed in the car. This makes no sense.

I can deal with these minor inconveniences - but then there are a few things about the car that make no fucking sense whatsoever. I have to assume the engineers who made these decisions have never driven a car before, or at least haven't since 1963. 

**The ugly:**  
Cruise control:  
It's very cool that you can switch between regular cruise control and assisted. What isn't cool is that the assisted control will sometimes hallucinate that a car is in your lane and slam on the breaks unceremoniously, or slam on the breaks instead of gradually slowing down when there's a car in front of you. It also can't see cars merging into the lane and can't see stoplights, red lights, or when a car is leaving the lane. Some of these seem pretty basic! And it's annoying that to switch between regular cruise control and assisted, you have to turn of cruise control and go FOUR CLICKS DEEP in the screen menu. What the fuck Volvo! Just make that weird left button that does nothing turn assist off and on.

Cameras:  
I didn't even think to ask when I bought the car if the cameras stored video. Tesla has done this for I think a decade, and it's an extremely obvious feature for both accidents and breakins. But not only do they not, there isn't even the capability to add this in the future. I hope letting thieves getting away with breaking into my car was worth the $31.42 it saved Volvo to not add a tiny chip that stores video.

"Glad you haven't had problems!

It's also a good idea to do the same with the door seals periodically. I've found it gets rid of the creaking over rough roads I've occasionally had that seems to come from nowhere and everywhere... a quick 15 minutes and I've got all four doors and windows done and then my interior is quiet again except for random stuff I have around the cabin of my car moving around.,2023-10-22 13:33:55,"Polestar Review

"Music you can let play when leaving the car by pushing the play button. 

Cup holders. There are two but only one easy to access. That was clear when purchasing. 

Seat as some say you have the base model so. Thats clear from the start.  

Low roof is no surprise. Each car is the size it it is . I think its great that not all cars are like houses. By the way, why would you sit in the back? 

Climate. Also no surprise that it had no button like an old car. Like someone said. Use google or auto and do not touch it when in auto. 

Cruise control. Check with service. Have had no issues with ghost braking. However, it do pick up on cars to far away and starts slowing down to their speed. That I agree is irritating and possibly something you would need to test to know. 


Storing video you also could know from the start. 
Also its strange to assume since it only Tesla that do it so not something to be considered standard. 
However, I agree it would be a nice option.

So all in all. 1 of all things you mentioned could be hard to know before driving the car.",2023-10-22 05:32:40,"Polestar Review

Has no one at Volvo ever taken a nap in the car before, leaned back and listened to music, or gotten road head? Why did they decide that no one should be able to recline their seat more than 10 degrees, and to do even that they have to crank this awful-ass wheel extremely slowly? I have to assume these engineers are all virgins who have never seen a car with lever recline before.   
When I complained to the dealership about this, they proudly said ""Volvos have had the wheel since 1963"" or some shit. What. The. Fuck. You mean to tell me it's been this broken since 1963 and no one has fixed it???

A few other things that bother me - making a call covers the map in the HUD, there's no option for aerowheels to extend range, and the app doesn't work unless you have both keys (and since I bought mine used, I only have one). Most of these things are easy fixes, so I hope someone at Polestar sees this and makes some updates.

I've had my Polestar 2 for 6 months and I love it. That said, a few things bother me that seem like easy fixes. I'm posting my review to get it off my chest and in the slight hope someone from Polestar will see this and fix them.  


**The Good:**  
Driving experience:  
Best in class. I test drove a lot of cars when making my purchasing decision, and the Polestar is the most fun I drove. It matched cars that cost three times what a Polestar does. Incredibly good.

Design:  
Let's just say it, a Polestar looks better than a Tesla. It looks incredible inside and out. There are other cars that looks as cool, but I'm not sure there are many that look better. 

Safety:  
There have been times when Polestar's collision avoidance potentially kept me from getting in an accident. I like that it automatically detects obstacles and prevents you from hitting them. A few things could be improved - adaptive cruise control can't see cars merging into your lane, for instance. But overall quite good.

These are the most important features of a car, so I'm overall quite pleased with my purchase. But there are some design decisions that leave me scratching my head, too.

**The bad:**  
Low ceiling:   
I'm 6'3"", and I can't sit up straight in the backseat. I crack my neck a lot and I can't do that even in the front seat without hitting the ceiling. It also reduces visibility. 

Climate control:   
Just give me buttons and dials that say ""hot"" on one end and ""cold"" on the other. I don't want to set a specific temperature on the screen - I can feel how hot or cold the air coming out is, and it's annoying to have to look away from the road and at the screen to set temperature. 

Center console:  
It's cool that there are side pockets and a deep center pocket, but I need two cupholders and a flat center pocket like everyone else gives me. 

Music:  
I do not understand why the car assumes I want the music to stop when I stand up. I never fucking want the music to stop. If I'm pregaming outside a venue, I want my music to keep playing, just like it did on my cheap as fuck 2016 Nissan Leaf. And Spotify is so hopelessly broken I had to uninstall it from the car, because not only does Spotify not work - if it's even open on my phone it will stop all sound from any app in the vehicle, as long as the app is also installed in the car. This makes no sense.

I can deal with these minor inconveniences - but then there are a few things about the car that make no fucking sense whatsoever. I have to assume the engineers who made these decisions have never driven a car before, or at least haven't since 1963. 

**The ugly:**  
Cruise control:  
It's very cool that you can switch between regular cruise control and assisted. What isn't cool is that the assisted control will sometimes hallucinate that a car is in your lane and slam on the breaks unceremoniously, or slam on the breaks instead of gradually slowing down when there's a car in front of you. It also can't see cars merging into the lane and can't see stoplights, red lights, or when a car is leaving the lane. Some of these seem pretty basic! And it's annoying that to switch between regular cruise control and assisted, you have to turn of cruise control and go FOUR CLICKS DEEP in the screen menu. What the fuck Volvo! Just make that weird left button that does nothing turn assist off and on.

Cameras:  
I didn't even think to ask when I bought the car if the cameras stored video. Tesla has done this for I think a decade, and it's an extremely obvious feature for both accidents and breakins. But not only do they not, there isn't even the capability to add this in the future. I hope letting thieves getting away with breaking into my car was worth the $31.42 it saved Volvo to not add a tiny chip that stores video.

"Most definitely. If it's far back, it'll hit the rear seats (assuming the wheeled version can recline as far as the electric version). Once I was bored so I decided to see how far my PP reclined, put it all the way back, then realised it was resting on the rear seat, so i scooted it forward and was able to recline further to its true bottom.

"There's a bit more to it then that.

In almost every nose to tail crash, the car that gets hit always looks better than the car that hit it.

Reason for this is simple, front crumple zones are designed to deform more than the rear.

This mostly has to do with whiplash, it's safer for the occupants initial motion to be pushed back into their seats than it is to be propelled forward and held back by the seat belt.

It also means that crash structure can stay more intact when being hit from behind because the occupants would actually be at a higher risk of injury if the rear completely crumpled.

Realistically there is nothing special about how either car has handled this situation.",2024-01-30 11:26:26,"If youve wondered if the polestar is safe

"Thanks, you've just listed the reasons why I'm planning to move to the p4 when my my22 p2 lease is up in early 2025 (US). Hopefully the availability won't slip too much (otherwise we'll ask to extend my lease, not sure if that can be done). The p2 is great but needs slightly more room in the back seats for a better experience for adults back there. I'll miss the logo on the sunroof. Hopefully the pricing is doable. And, hoping I can get one made in China with the experienced production line.

I do need to see the front in person, it looks very soft / wimpy / tech sleek EV rather than a nicely designed car from the pictures I've seen. I can't quite reconcile the design team and brand creating something so Tesla looking ? I hope I like it better in person!

Visited a showroom last month in China for the polestar 4. Couple of observations:

1. Much larger than the P2 with the benefit of having a very roomy interior. Rear seat leg space is more than double of p*2. As the sunroof now extends above the rear passenger head, 

2. Build quality is superb, Id say the cabin feels much higher quality than the 2. The new material is much finer and seats are softer. Minimal glossy piano black surfaces is a plus. The new ambient light is a really nice and subtle touch. Center console is now lower so it doesnt hinder leg space. Boot ledge is now metal etc, shows that polestar has been listening to out complains regarding p*2

3. Much better storage space design (more cup holders) and cubby space. Boot has a floor that can adjust in height so you have a boot floor that is level with the ledge. Two benefits, allow a flat lay bed space for camping and makes it easier to load/unload items from the boot. Being able to adjust rear seat inclination is also really comfortable. 

4. Much more tech incorporated into it. Popups are now available so you can have 3 apps running concurrently. 360 camera is now much more advance being able to move the perspective around and see whats underneath your car. Better self driving including auto lane change, entering and exiting the freeway by itself, possible auto-parking feature. Electronically adjusted steering wheel, face ID system to determine seat and steering wheel position, really clear HUD showing positions of the car in lane and surrounding vehicles etc. Phone mirroring so you can mirror your phone apps onto the screen. Much more to come as well. Soft closing doors are 

5. The digital rear view mirror has great definition and field of view. Field of view of the front is great and blind spots are now smaller. 

Negatives
1. No more projected polestar logo on the sun roof. 

2. Smaller frunk (this was a dual motor model) 

3. No more electrochromatic roof (apparently too unreliable and was removed as an option) 

4. Not a fan of the headlights and more curved front. Wished they kept the Thors hammer design previously. 

5. Option to have the starry ambient light in the side door panels (the one within the fabric) comes with same exterior colour body panel which is dislike. Makes the car looks too tall and out of proportion with the windows. 

Feel free to ask other questions and Ill try to answer them.",Reddit
"So great to read these insights! I do have so many questions :D 

1. Did you not get the chance to test drive it?
2. does the boot feel larger in general compared to the PS2? we know that it technically is bigger, but the sloping rear end makes me question it's usable size a bit.
3. does the infotainment seem a bit too ""overloaded"" or did you find its menus to be well structured in logical way where you would not have to click through multiple menus to get to simple functions?
4. important one: sound quality - the harman kardon in the ps2 really isn't that good imo. Any insights there for the ps4? any upgrade speakers available..?
5. Which seats did you experience? the leather one or another? 
6. What do you think about the head up display? decent amount of information shown or is it lacking a bit?

Visited a showroom last month in China for the polestar 4. Couple of observations:

1. Much larger than the P2 with the benefit of having a very roomy interior. Rear seat leg space is more than double of p*2. As the sunroof now extends above the rear passenger head, 

2. Build quality is superb, Id say the cabin feels much higher quality than the 2. The new material is much finer and seats are softer. Minimal glossy piano black surfaces is a plus. The new ambient light is a really nice and subtle touch. Center console is now lower so it doesnt hinder leg space. Boot ledge is now metal etc, shows that polestar has been listening to out complains regarding p*2

3. Much better storage space design (more cup holders) and cubby space. Boot has a floor that can adjust in height so you have a boot floor that is level with the ledge. Two benefits, allow a flat lay bed space for camping and makes it easier to load/unload items from the boot. Being able to adjust rear seat inclination is also really comfortable. 

4. Much more tech incorporated into it. Popups are now available so you can have 3 apps running concurrently. 360 camera is now much more advance being able to move the perspective around and see whats underneath your car. Better self driving including auto lane change, entering and exiting the freeway by itself, possible auto-parking feature. Electronically adjusted steering wheel, face ID system to determine seat and steering wheel position, really clear HUD showing positions of the car in lane and surrounding vehicles etc. Phone mirroring so you can mirror your phone apps onto the screen. Much more to come as well. Soft closing doors are

Rear camera is good enough, you sure it's not dirty? I do agree that it gets muddy too fast and it should've included a sprayer or automatic cleaner. 

Center console, adjust your seat, it's comfortable even for 6'4"" with the correct seat position.

Had the P2 for 9 months now and wanted to share a few opinions, things that I like and others I dont. 

On the whole, its a solid car and is quite quick for a 2 tonne lump. Our previous car was. Mercedes CLA class (shooting brake AMG line). 

Overall, were happy with it and think its a great EV, better looking than the Tesla M3 and inside is for the most part really good. Would 100% have another and probably look at the P4 when its in the UK. Theres a few bits that could do with some attention, and for a 50k car would expect to be better. 

The keyless entry is the worst. The car acknowledges youre at the car, but doesnt open. It then takes a while for the car to actually unlock, through multiple attempts at the handle. Im not sure what the bug is, but man its annoying. 

The rear camera is so bad. I know good cams exist, because the merc one was fantastic. For a 50k car, this isnt acceptable. Not to mention the camera software doesnt work at times, and keeps blinking when reversing. 

The sun visor doesnt stay in position and keeps snapping closed. Again, its the small things in a premium car that should just work. 

The advertised range to actual, is miles off (no pun intended). Im sure this is for most EVs, but still annoying. 

The centre console needs redesigning as its super uncomfortable - leg clashing with the triangular feature.

Fully agree. It's fine in full light, but God help you if it's night time. I live in far northern Europe so bad night time reversing is particularly annoying.

>The sun visor doesnt stay in position

This sounds like a defect though, or user error. I've never encountered this issue.

>Arm rest / cup holder

I do agree their design of this is super weird. It hasn't been a deal breaker for me since I don't really use either feature but to design it like that at all is a bit cracked.

>The advertised range to actual, is miles off

Now, the big one. Oh boy. I'm on an LRSM 2024 model. Advertised range = 655km

**Actual range has been less than half that, if even.**

I get about 3km per 1% of battery. I took a recent road trip, 234km to the charger. Started at 93%, got there at 27%. This is not even remotely close to the advertised range. It's about 45% less, in fact. I find this a pretty insane difference and well beyond a reasonable margin.

Full disclosure on my end, temperature is between 0 and -10C and we are on studded winter tired and driving over minor snow, each of these I'd expect to have an impact but not to the tune of a 40% drop in advertised range.",2023-12-27 16:07:46,"General Polestar Stuff

I agree with the camera being sub optimal, even when its clean and its nice and bright out, its mediocre at best, when its rainy, its unusable.

The center console and cup holder situation is a long running joke with the PS2, its truly awful and not sure why they thought that would be a good idea.

I will add that the infotainment is pretty lackluster overall, compared to many other cars, EV or ICE, not just that its laggy, the whole design is poor and outdated.

It all overall points to the first generation issues which I hope theyve addressed with the newer models that theyve built from ground up. Very much looking forward to the PS4, I hope they release more details for the US market soon.",2023-12-27 16:53:55,"General Polestar Stuff

On the whole, its a solid car and is quite quick for a 2 tonne lump. Our previous car was. Mercedes CLA class (shooting brake AMG line). 

Overall, were happy with it and think its a great EV, better looking than the Tesla M3 and inside is for the most part really good. Would 100% have another and probably look at the P4 when its in the UK. Theres a few bits that could do with some attention, and for a 50k car would expect to be better. 

The keyless entry is the worst. The car acknowledges youre at the car, but doesnt open. It then takes a while for the car to actually unlock, through multiple attempts at the handle. Im not sure what the bug is, but man its annoying. 

The rear camera is so bad. I know good cams exist, because the merc one was fantastic. For a 50k car, this isnt acceptable. Not to mention the camera software doesnt work at times, and keeps blinking when reversing. 

The sun visor doesnt stay in position and keeps snapping closed. Again, its the small things in a premium car that should just work. 

The advertised range to actual, is miles off (no pun intended). Im sure this is for most EVs, but still annoying. 

The centre console needs redesigning as its super uncomfortable - leg clashing with the triangular feature.

"Drinking in the car is fine, however there are more spaces to store drinks in your car than the cupholders. 

A cupholder is designed for a small cup, and in that case a cup can fit under the armrest. 

Since Volvo is particularly a safety focused brand that tightly enforces local rules, it makes sense that they also enforce the no eating/drinking rule while driving rule. (Classified as z distraction while driving, is a major offense and is equal as calling in a car) (not my opinion just the law) 

So I have a big bottle in my door, and sometimes a small can in the cup holder. 

So if you are driving with a passenger you can easily take 2 big bottles and 1 small cup or can. Which should be enough to drink I guess?",2023-12-27 20:13:24,"General Polestar Stuff

It's all about expectations and research before you buy a car. The issue about the cupholder is well documented and is very obvious when you see the interior of the car in person.

If you have different needs, maybe you shouldn't have bought the car instead of complaining on the internet.

I agree it's bad design but I don't agree this makes the car cheap or not worth the pricetag.

I think the hidden one is designed for the driver since while driving it's not allowed to eat or drink in most European countries, as it's classified a distraction.

Nationality affects the complaint because it's the same as complaining a humongous American SUV doesn't fit in European lanes or parking spots.

For open cans look into the 3D printed cup holder for the door frame or the one that can be attached to the glovebox. 

If you like it you can even make it out of metal. 

I know it should be included by default and more thought should have been put into the design but the middle console has a ton of batteries in it so the car has a lower form factor. 

Don't forget the car was a concept car from Volvo based on an ICE platform and not inherently designed as an EV.

The keyless entry is the worst. The car acknowledges youre at the car, but doesnt open. It then takes a while for the car to actually unlock, through multiple attempts at the handle. Im not sure what the bug is, but man its annoying. 

The rear camera is so bad. I know good cams exist, because the merc one was fantastic. For a 50k car, this isnt acceptable. Not to mention the camera software doesnt work at times, and keeps blinking when reversing. 

The sun visor doesnt stay in position and keeps snapping closed. Again, its the small things in a premium car that should just work. 

The advertised range to actual, is miles off (no pun intended). Im sure this is for most EVs, but still annoying. 

The centre console needs redesigning as its super uncomfortable - leg clashing with the triangular feature.

Hey all,

I was actually interested in the Polestar 2 back when it launched, but due to financial reasons at the time, it didn't make sense for me to buy one then.

I looked at the car again and saw that used Polestar 2s have depreciated like crazy here in the United States. I've seen 2021MY used P*2s with PP, Plus Package, Pilot Package, and Nappa leather go in the $30k range all day long.
 
It seems... tempting but... does there seem to be any major ""catch""? For example, in the mid 2010s (and even today), a lot of 10y Mercedes-Benz AMG cars often sold for like 10% of their original MSRP, with the reason being that they were just really unreliable money pits. I wonder if that's the case with the P*2. What are the common issues out there? I remember 2y ago when I was on this sub, I saw a lot of people talk about TCAM issues affecting their car.

"Year 21 was the first car of the first gen, bound to have issues. I don't have any definitive surveys in front of me but judging by even recent posts on forums, year 21s may still have minor unresolvable hardware issues. Nothing too serious though. Also they don't have heat pump. 

Year 22, AWD Plus and Pilot is what I consider the sweetspot package, and can be had for $36k ex-rental ~15k miles. I checked the Polestar website, same packages CPO can be had for $40k and above. Example: https://www.polestar.com/us/preowned-cars/product/013ac001-400a-4f4a-ac26-dd9a373ad1cf

"No. That may be the dream, but right now Porsche is just a poster on Polestar's bedroom wall. Polestar is essentially a premium Volvo package, which puts it up in line against Audi's basic A series models. The performance pack puts the P2 in S3 territory. The P3 might be competitive against a basic Q7 but the upper-trim Q8 is still an objectively more premium overall product, and I'd take even a *gas* Macan over the P4, which appears to continue the disappointingly entry-level vibe of the P2.

Polestar fails to beat Audi at every level, let alone meet or exceed Porsche:

* Design: aesthetic preferences aside, Polestar's approach to design is just incomplete. Porsche frets over every seam and intersection, the weight of the buttons, and even the switch mechanism of the turn signal lever is damped and weighted. Polestar has a decent overall language but many of the individual details don't resolve, and tactile surfaces include clicky plastic and a chintzy volume knob that looks like it was borrowed from a Kia. It has also made some strange omissions in UI, like using barely 50% of the driver display even in map mode and mismatching interior LED colors. Then there are the unforced errors like the cupholder and the key fob.
* Engineering: while the performance package is a nice touch on Polestar, every Porsche, even the SUVs, gets tuned for driving and suspension performance. The Polestar has an overly firm ride, no active dampening, no air suspension, and you can feel its weight in the corners. It handles well for a midrange EV but even the BMW i4 has better overall chassis engineering. The P3 motors might be breaking new ground, but the P2 isn't reaching any new heights of efficiency, range, or technology in the way that Porsche is a leader across OEMs. Reliability overall remains to be seen but both Polestar and Audi/Porsche EVs appear mechanically solid with some hiccups.
* Software technology: this might be a tie, depending on what you value. Both have had reliability issues, but Audi/Porsche infotainment is far more feature-complete. Audi's post-2018 MMI is also more customizable. Polestar has the Google services built in, which if they do what you need/want, are easier to use.
* Materials quality: not even a comparison here. Polestar uses some inexcusably cheap materials in its carpets, headliners, fake wood facing, and even its panel seams are exposed (rub your knee against the center console and you can find that unfinished lip easily). Their sheet metal is thinner, acoustic glass is not available, and they can't even seem to get an aftermarket sunshade working right for the glass roof.
* Manufacturing: Porsche runs a tremendously complex customization and order system, both in terms of the ""menu"" of options as well as personalization off menu. Polestar is a rigidly-designed setup with minimal SKUs. There's also no factory tour or headquarters experience.
* Sales and service: some of the Polestar Spaces are nice. Others, not so much. But even the nice ones lack the amenities of a standard Audi dealer (no espresso bar, free snacks, comfortable lounge areas).  My Porsche dealer has brought me lunch just because I happened to be there around lunchtime. Meanwhile, I'm barely offered a bottled water at my Polestar space, which has a service waiting room with 1990s hand-me-down office furniture and horrific fluorescent lights. Obviously, service interaction and quality is variable by location, but Polestar is going much more minimal.
* Racing and brand prestige: obviously Polestar has not substantiated its credentials in this space. It's a relatively little-known brand with no true supercars and no competition wins since its days as a Volvo tuner on strictly Volvo models. This will take time to develop.

Polestar is the electric Acura. Nice enough, but no threat to any of the Germans above Volkswagen. It's still *very* difficult to see where or why Geely decided Polestar needed to be its own brand instead of Volvo's answer to Audi's ""S"" models. They already have Lotus to aim at Porsche, and Volvo isn't leaving much daylight between their models and Polestar's on shared platforms. The P6 is the only product Volvo doesn't have a confusingly similar alternative to.",2023-12-28 02:23:56,"Do you think Polestar competes with Porsche?

"Nah, it's just flashier. The S3 and P2 Perf are pretty evenly matched. Both are about 4 seconds 0-60, with the P2 a hair faster because of the EV instant torque advantage and the S3 much flatter in cornering because of its 1100 pound weight advantage.

The P2 does the quarter mile about a half second faster because of that acceleration advantage. On the other hand, the S3 has better lateral grip on the skidpad (.96 vs. .93g), shorter stopping distances (151 vs 160ft from 70mph), and higher top speed (155mph limited). The 2016 S3 is about a second slower around the Mending circuit than the P2 performance (2:03 vs 2:02), and about a second faster around the Autozeitung track (1:42 vs 1:43). And the 2022 model is faster, so should beat the P2 at both, but hasn't been timed yet.

The S3 definitely turns and rides better overall as well, though I don't know how to measure that.

Don't get me wrong, the P2 is fun to drive for an EV, but I can tell you I'd still rather have my RS5 back. Even though it was 11 years older, it was still faster, better handling, and nicer to be in than the Polestar (other than the useless back seats). And the Cayman just wipes the floor with the P2 *and* my RS5.",2023-12-28 03:27:59,"Do you think Polestar competes with Porsche?

The 4 might have even more rear legroom from what they've shown so far.  4 has what looks like a next gen interior compared to the 3.

We gotta separate ""competitor"" and ""alternative"". In terms of price, build quality and luxury, Porsche and Polestar are competitors.

Hi 

I really love the polestar 4. Im looking for a new car and my budget limit is around 65k.

P4 base model is 65k with 600km range and still looks nice as far as I can see. I wouldve liked the nappa seats but it requires me to take the plus pack so it immediately adds like 10k to the car.

My biggest doubt is the (by ev standards) slow acceleration of 7 seconds. It will be my first electric car and Ive been excited for it cause of the fast speeds, but this one is just a tad bit faster as my current car.

Am I out of my mind for considering the base model? Will it be hard for me to sell my car in 4-5 years?

Polestar 2 is overpriced cause Im paying the same price as a PS4 and the only thing I gain is some performance.

My other options are model 3, model y or EX30.

"Polestar has done a lot of things right. It has arguably the most distinctive and progressive designs both on the exterior and interior which are unseen on any other cars. The handling is even better than a BMW.  The build quality is great  ignore those China haters who has no idea what the amazing highly skilled Chinese manufacturers l/workers are capable of and despise anything made in China (this regressive attitude will come back and hunt sooner rather than later). The ride quality is also second to none. Needless to say its safety features and rating. However, the software needs to do lots of catching up with Tesla and the after sales service and brand recognition. Last but not least the pricing needs to be more competitive and pls get rid of so many different variants of the same car, making it more streamlined and pack more packs as default and dump the ICE-age thinking of selling packs, its supposed to be a smart EV car so dont cripple it using optional packs.

On top of that it drove the best and had one of the nicest interiors besides, maybe the BMW. The Polestar tech needs to update more quickly however.

"The size isn't an issue (it's only 20cm longer and not significantly wider), but the turning radius is woeful - feels like driving a bus.


I wrote a more in-depth comparison elsewhere, I'll check and try to link it here.


A short summary:


The i4 (eDrive40) is the overall and objectively better car, but the Polestar is more fun.


In terms of comfort, tech, noise levels, overall build quality, and highway efficiency, the i4 is superior.


The Polestar has more direct steering, (much) better throttle calibration,you can set OPD up exactly how you want, it doesn't need to be started or turned off, it looks better (imo), has a frunk, and it feels/is A LOT faster (compared to the non-M50 i4) due to the insane torque on all PS2 models.


Both havegood chassis tuning, great infotainment (though the Polestar is more intuitive and has Google Maps built-in), very good seats, similarly-sized boots, and cramped rear seats.",2024-01-29 07:39:39,"Polestar 2, Mach E, Audi Q4, and BMW I4

"Macan is a lot smaller,.. And if you spec the Macan 4 exactly the same as the LRDM P3 it's 30K more than the P3, if you compare the P3 Performance and the Macan Turbo at the same specs you're looking at a difference of more than 40K.

So 30-40K more for a smaller car.

The Porsche looks nice on paper, but the base version lacks a lot of stuff, these are just the first couple of things that I can remember:

* no panoramic roof
* no sport seats
* no air suspension
* no HUD
* no seat warmers
* no premium audio

The interior is very nice and easy on the eye. These are China prices: starts from RMB345000 and tops out at about RMB750000 fully loaded. The saleswoman said that the ""recommended""  configuration priced out at RMB390000. That's for a Single Motor with some add-ons. Not sure if that is for the Long Range version. 
As an aside, Polestar have no interest selling the P2 in China. The MY2024 P2 was not even on display nor available for test drive. An old-style grille P2 was on display-not sure what year-and another was plugged in for test drive. I saw only ONE P2 in Chengdu on my way to the airport.

"A big factor that nobody is mentioning is the absurd starting price. The P2 is absolutely not worth 60-70k. The quality is honestly like a Mazda, not as good as Volvo and Volvo is even considered below the Germans or Lexus/Genesis/Acura in the luxury segment. P2 is not a luxury vehicle. It also has EV specs worse than multiple other competitors that are cheaper by 5-15k such as the Model 3P/LR, Model 3 base, Ioniq 5, EV6, etc. If the P2 was appropriately priced to begin with (50-55k) then the current 37-45k valuation would be incredibly normal depreciation.

Nobody can even justify the fully loaded 70k price, it's just hilarious. Anyone who knows about and has tried many cars would agree the P2 shouldn't be anywhere near 70k and even 60k is a stretch. Most of the interior is cheap plastics that are admittedly fit together exceptionally. 

Its a super cool car but jotice that as an EV it is priced almost near the Model S which specs wise annihilates it, and thats not even mentioning all the 40k competitors that beat it. As a performance vehicle it is not one, its only close competitor as a pseudo performance car is the model 3 performance which definitely has it beat there besides the brakes. As a luxury vehicle even a 40k lexus comes with better seats, materials and features. 

If you like Polestar start demanding that they stop pricing their product so far above its quality, or improve the materials, features and design to match the price. This brand will absolutely leave the US within the next 5 years if its p4 don't take off. This is the only model that seems to offer good features and specs for the price.

"My theory is that Polestar is a completely 'early adopter' brand and those folks buy the newest gadgets.  I keep looking at used P2's and can't bring myself to buy one because I'm at least 100 miles from a polestar dealer for service.  I can't get a straight answer out of Polestar about Polestar extended warranties either.

Also, I heard about the awesome: don't worry about the distance, we'll come get it - only to then hear the horror stories that they will come get it 'some day' and 'maybe give you a loaner'.  

Koons Volvo of Whitemarsh has 8 P2's - 2021 Launch editions, they seem to drop the price $500 to $1000 at least once a week.  Some amazing looking deals there: a blue one with the barley leather interior with under 3000 miles!! a freaking brand new car almost - but with warranty concerns - for I think 37,500 now?  Its hard not to run down there waving my fist of cash at them, but then I can just picture myself in six months with an issue and having to watch it get towed off to be gone for weeks at who knows what cost?

I can afford a Ford EV and have 4 dealers to choose from within 25 minutes of my house.  A 2022 Mach E AWD with 5,000 miles is sitting around 44k at a dealer near me.  I think it may be worth the 7/8k difference to have so much service available.

the P2 dual motor AWD is amazing to drive and I like how it looks and all that stuff, seems like a crime they are this cheap, but they are still not cheap enough for me to buy.",2023-07-27 22:05:34,"Polestar 2 High Depreciation

"That's always up to you. But if the choice was mine, I'd go for the P2, but probably not for the reasons you think. 

The Polestar 4 is 2 meters wide, 4.8 meters long. I'm thinking that if central Stockholm is like central Copenhagen, you'll find a lot of parking spots that are 2.30m wide. That leaves you with 30 cm of room to open the door if the car next to you is of the same size. 

I know a few Tesla Model Y owners who struggle with parking in central Copenhagen (Model Y is only 1.9m meters wide). Unless they find a VW Polo to park next to, they simply cannot open the door. 

The Polestar 2 is also a wide car, 1.85m wide and 4.6m long. Still on the large side for a city car but much more manageable.

"OP, I will share my personal experience after over three years driving a Polestar 2 with a family that varies between 4 or 5 people throughout the year. It is snug but comfy if you're a family of three, as you are. There's plenty leg room at the back for long journeys. If, however, like me you're a larger family, then on long journeys the person in the middle is not going to have a great time. We have driven from London to Scotland for about 550 miles with five people in the car and a fully loaded boot and frunk. It's doable if your family are hardy and non-complainers and can put up with ""short term pain for long term gain"", as it were. It's an amazingly pleasurable car to drive and I would lease it again. The drive dynamics are superb. The hard suspension gives it more of a sports car feel than a gentle, family car feel. We got used to that quickly. Initially the hard suspension made us go ""hmmmm"" but a few hundred miles in and realising how well the car handles we learned to use the feel of the road to add to the enjoyable handling of the car. V The boot space is ok. This week I picked up family from Heathrow airport. There were four people with three full size suitcases and one carry-on case. I could only fit one full size suitcase in the boot with space for the carry on and ladies handbag and a paper bag with some items in it. We did fit a bulky laptop bag into the lower boot as well with the rest on top and the shelf removed (taken out and left at home in anticipation of a tight fit). It is impossible to get more than one large suitcase into the polestar 2's boot without lowering at least one seat. This was not an option for me as I had a fully loaded passenger compliment. The rest of the luggage went in an Uber to the hotel with one passenger.

Looking at the P4 specs it's a much wider car with a bigger boot. I think you should be able to squeeze two full size suitcases in with ease. I believe the P4 boot also electronically lowers, which means you may also be able to place two additional carry on cases on top of the suitcases and still close the lid. Maybe  We'll have to wait and see. It's a pity that most car show rooms, including Polestar spaces, don't keep demo suitcases on site to allow potential buyers in the ""I'm exploring my options"" phase to robustly test out boot space.

I hope this helps in your decision making process. In conclusion the P2 is awesome! I love it and it has served us well. It's a little cramped but we can deal with it. I think I'll go for the P4 for the additional space and the flat floor for better rear passenger comfort. The kids are both teenagers now and if they don't stop growing at the pace they are I might need a stretched limo soon!",2023-12-23 14:21:29,"Help!

"When it comes to cargo volume I'd also encourage considering how the space is laid out. The Polestar has great space for a hatchback, but the high load floor/hump in the trunk plus the narrow openings for the trunk/doors make it difficult to move things that are weird sizes. If you only have suitcases/backpacks, then sure the P2 will be able to maximize the cargo volume to its fullest, but what about objects that are both tall and wide? Or are weird shapes? Etc.


For example couldn't get my birdcage into my P2 because the trunk was height was not sufficient, at the same time, I couldn't fit it into the rear or front passenger seats because the doorsill was also too narrow and small even though the space would have been sufficient to set the cage on the floor. With the EX-30, while i haven't had the opportunity to measure my birdcage height and width, i assume would be able to handle the cage just fine because of the boxy design.",2023-12-20 16:33:08,"Help!

Ive currently been driving the Polestar 2 for the past 5 months and put about 15,000 miles on it so far. Its not a remarkable car by any means. It has so many cons compared to the pros.

Pros:

- Its very responsive to the acceleration and braking, but this could be due to the fact that it is all electric. Ive never driven any other electric car to compare it to. 

- It has a nice body design compared to other electric sedans. 

Cons:

- The infotainment system crashes on me multiple times a day and I have to hard reset it because I lose all audio for turning signals and other features as well. About 5 months ago this use to be at least 10-15 times a day and with software updates it has become less frequent. 

- The automatic braking sensors for being close to an object is horribly calibrated. The sensors in the front have caused the car to randomly brake when a car in another lane next to me is turning into a plaza. When I reverse it constantly brakes for me from the change of the road to grass that is on the street level. They need to recalibrate those sensors and how they detect objects. 

- Whos the idiot that decided to put a cup holder in the center console compartment. 

- The oddly shaped shift knob blocks my view of the button behind it on the passenger side from any angle unless Im right up against the steering wheel. 

- The infotainment system has bezels thicker than a TV from 10 years ago. 

- The air conditioning button is not on every screen on the infotainment system. I usually have to go to the CarPlay screen to find the air conditioning button.

"On the cons, I don't think your experience is typical:

* A constantly crashing infotainment system is not normal. I'm in my car like 4 hours a day, using a lot of AA apps as well as CarPlay, and it rarely crashes. Have you tried a system reset to factory settings and reinstalling your user? It's a pain, but it might fix more than a simple reboot.
* The front braking has saved me a couple times. Never had a false positive on the braking, though occasionally the alert sound will fire due to a car in the next lane. I do agree with you on the reverse braking. I simply turn off the autobrake when I'm backing into my driveway.
* This doesn't bother me as there are three other drink holders in the car. And I really don't like people having food and drink in my car anyway. But why does it bother you so much?
* I like the shift knob and don't understand why you need to see that button
* Yep, thick bezels.

"> The oddly shaped shift knob blocks my view of the button behind it on the passenger side from any angle unless Im right up against the steering wheel.

Ive currently been driving the Polestar 2 for the past 5 months and put about 15,000 miles on it so far. Its not a remarkable car by any means. It has so many cons compared to the pros.

Pros:

- Its very responsive to the acceleration and braking, but this could be due to the fact that it is all electric. Ive never driven any other electric car to compare it to. 

- It has a nice body design compared to other electric sedans. 

Cons:

- The infotainment system crashes on me multiple times a day and I have to hard reset it because I lose all audio for turning signals and other features as well. About 5 months ago this use to be at least 10-15 times a day and with software updates it has become less frequent. 

- The automatic braking sensors for being close to an object is horribly calibrated. The sensors in the front have caused the car to randomly brake when a car in another lane next to me is turning into a plaza. When I reverse it constantly brakes for me from the change of the road to grass that is on the street level. They need to recalibrate those sensors and how they detect objects. 

- Whos the idiot that decided to put a cup holder in the center console compartment. 

- The oddly shaped shift knob blocks my view of the button behind it on the passenger side from any angle unless Im right up against the steering wheel. 

- The infotainment system has bezels thicker than a TV from 10 years ago. 

- The air conditioning button is not on every screen on the infotainment system. I usually have to go to the CarPlay screen to find the air conditioning button.

"I did have a bad experience with the crash detection. I was sitting at an intersection trying to make a left and the road ahead goes up a hill and around a turn where a building obscures the road as it turns.

For whatever reason, people come flying down that hill and it makes turning left there a bit harrowing. In any case I wasn't moving and a car comes flying around the turn down the hill, but entirely in it's lane.

"I guess you didn't get one of the better PS2's. The only point I agree fully on is the (downright scary the first times it happened ) panic braking when reversing, which is pretty annoying. But it's possible to turn if off (but you have to do it every time you start again) And while I usually have my drinks in bottles whenever my SO has a cup of coffee on a long trip I essentially have no right arm rest. 

Off course it will vary what country you buy it, but here in Norway it was pretty much the most you could get for your money until Tesla dropped the model Y price this year, and it's still not a bad deal unless you want the Performance pack or leather seats.",2023-10-04 21:56:13,"Polestar 2 isnt worth it

Not OP, but it's my main issue with the car. The center console is not useable enough. The C40 is not perfect either, but it's damn better than the Polestar 2.

I'm not a big fan of cup holders, prefer them hidden away, but I do use them on long trips in the summer. When you do the odd 800 to 1000km trip in the summer under 40 it's nice to have a couple of water bottles at hand.",2023-10-04 16:48:49,"Polestar 2 isnt worth it

"Its a good car and I dont regret buying it, but it is clear that this model will never be a *great* car, mainly for 3 broad reasons:

1. Its overpriced in the US compared to the market (unique to USA, not a global issue). This is an electric S40 that can be optioned up to 70K and runs about 60K in a competitive configuration. 

2. It was actively sold as a car with lots of future advancements coming. None have materialized except CarPlay, which was promised two years before it was delivered. They opted not to deliver on their pixel headlight implementation not because it was impossible, but because they didnt want to. AAOS has basically gone nowhere in 3 years other than bugfixes. The massive 12 driver display is 40% empty even in map view and is the worst digital gauge cluster on the market in terms of features (Polestar is not fixing it and instead moving to a small display or no display in future models).

3. Their design team isnt as good as they think they are. In addition to pretending the basic gauge cluster is intentional and that the center display is too small for multiple functions (obviously not true given the move to a smaller gauge display and the fact that CarPlay easily shows 3 apps concurrently), they claim that their non configurable cabin lighting is better than allowing for customization (but didnt even bother color matching the 3 different white points in the car), and the whole center console/cupholder thing is just bad design. The XC40 recharge makes much better use of space. 

A full list of my annoyances has also been posted here (extreme nitpick version).

None of that is meant to discourage you from buying it. Lots of people love it. The overall industry reaction is that its pretty mid unless driving dynamics are top of your list.",2023-10-04 17:03:08,"Polestar 2 isnt worth it




Ive currently been driving the Polestar 2 for the past 5 months and put about 15,000 miles on it so far. Its not a remarkable car by any means. It has so many cons compared to the pros.

Pros:

- Its very responsive to the acceleration and braking, but this could be due to the fact that it is all electric. Ive never driven any other electric car to compare it to. 

- It has a nice body design compared to other electric sedans. 

Cons:

- The infotainment system crashes on me multiple times a day and I have to hard reset it because I lose all audio for turning signals and other features as well. About 5 months ago this use to be at least 10-15 times a day and with software updates it has become less frequent. 

- The automatic braking sensors for being close to an object is horribly calibrated. The sensors in the front have caused the car to randomly brake when a car in another lane next to me is turning into a plaza. When I reverse it constantly brakes for me from the change of the road to grass that is on the street level. They need to recalibrate those sensors and how they detect objects. 

- Whos the idiot that decided to put a cup holder in the center console compartment. 

- The oddly shaped shift knob blocks my view of the button behind it on the passenger side from any angle unless Im right up against the steering wheel. 

- The infotainment system has bezels thicker than a TV from 10 years ago. 

- The air conditioning button is not on every screen on the infotainment system. I usually have to go to the CarPlay screen to find the air conditioning button.

"There are different settings for it so you may want to make sure what setting it's on.  If I remember right there are 3 settings....I have it on the middle one because the early detection was going off far too soon.  You also have emergency braking in reverse...it's harsh and feels like you slammed into something....but got out of the car when it happened and realized I wasn't backing out straight , I was distracted and under a lot of stress so it prevented damage to the car and the garage door track. I do love this car and after 14 months I still wouldn't want to drive anything else even with the few minor shortcomings.",2023-10-06 15:01:01,"Polestar 2 isnt worth it

"I feel like I should ask why you care about 360 cameras when you clearly have skills to park on your own? :-) 

My point is that the existence or use of the feature isn't about skill or lack of it, and it's silly to insist or imply that anyone who wants this lacks the ability to parallel park normally or in weird situations. Just like lane keep assist or adaptive cruise, this is only another tool that reduces driver overhead. 

Personally, I grew up and learned to drive with farm and offroad equipment. I can parallel a trailer in a single go - it's not about skill. Now that I am no longer a rural kid, I use the feature every day at school drop off, as little kids with no awareness of surroundings (and who can't easily be seen at the height of a full size SUV) pop up everywhere. I feel much more comfortable controlling only a brake while looking around for surprise kids trying to kill themselves. In my oughty audi without so much as a backup camera, focus was a lot more diffuse when parallel parking. It's certainly safer to have my attention more focused when using this feature.  

Separately, I don't know about BMW, but for Volvo there's no ""setup up the gizmo to do its thing"" delay apart from pressing a single button in the infotainment screen a few meters before a spot you've identified.

I feel you on the bundling though. Annoying. I recall frustration that my only option for a girthy steering wheel and black headliner was a $$$$ sports package for one of my volvos.",2023-05-30 18:48:15,"Polestar 4 Specifications

"You are adorable, but can you please stop bothering me? lol

An SUV, or Sport Utility Vehicle, is a type of vehicle that combines features of a traditional passenger car with those of a truck. SUVs are generally characterized by their higher ground clearance, spacious interiors, and often have a four-wheel-drive capability. They are designed to handle a variety of terrains and offer ample cargo space, making them popular for families and individuals who need versatility in their vehicles.

An SUV coup is a subcategory of SUVs that blends elements of a traditional SUV with the sportier and more stylish design of a coup. These vehicles typically have a sloping roofline and a more streamlined, coupe-like appearance compared to the boxier shape of conventional SUVs. The goal is to combine the practicality and versatility of an SUV with a more sporty and dynamic aesthetic.

"As someone who owns both a Polestar 2 and a Mach-E I can tell you that even though the Mach-E has about a half inch to almost a full inch less ground clearance than a 2 depending on trim, the Mach-E drives, sits and feels way more like an SUV than the 2 does.  A big part of why the Mach-E has such little ground clearance is because of how the battery hangs so low under the car but you sit higher in the car, its six inches taller than a 2, four inches longer and a quarter ton heavier.

"Ya, in all honestly its hard to go new when the used prices are so spectacular. Just do your due diligence in research, pick up a used one, and pocket the extra 20-25k. As a heads up, there is a 1k off costco deal for preowned ones if you want to go that route. The car is not as quiet as some competitors like the i4, but it is sufficiently quiet. It also comes in much cheaper used. As for comfort, it depends on whether you like the enclosed feeling and somewhat intrusive center console, but I find the seats to be very comfortable. Polestar does not offer wool seats. If those are really important, you could look into a used XC40 Recharge. Polestar does offer textile and weavetech seats though. Both are fairly nice materials in my opinion, and worth feeling and experiencing to see if you like them. Textile is kind of like traditional cloth, but a more rough and sturdy. Weavetech is honestly hard to describe but its like a very dense cloth that also feels very sturdy. You just have to feel it yourself lol. Either options seem premium and durable, but not necessarily luxurious. For that, you could try the leather. For options, I would say definitely get Pilot and avoid performance if you want a smooth and comfortable ride. Whether to get plus or not depends on which seats you like more and whether you want the panoramic roof, but it does give some other luxury comforts like heated steering, full power seats, and more. I would probably just get plus too. The leather is up to your preference as well.",2023-12-26 22:12:58,"Considering a Polestar

Let's say the next time Polestar needs a cash infusion, Geely say no. Polestar would go bankrupt. In a bankruptcy Geely as the primary debt holder and major equity owner could liquidate them (not much liquidate as Polestar is a design/brand shop) or just absorb the assets.

I have heard a lot of people say that the Polestar 2 is overpriced, but if you compare a similarly specced Polestar 2 to an BMW i4, the Polestar 2 is around 5 - 10k cheaper (ex. PS2 LRDM vs i4 xdrive 40 with similar options). The i4 is a larger car and has free EA charging still, which will account for something. Additionally, someone could make the argument that the BMW is a higher quality car (though I would say imo sentatec feels cheaper than weavetech and of course Nappa leather is better than the leather in the i4), but even then the price differential is more than enough to justify this.

For less than $2500, you get more range, more interior space, a far better and more functional suite of in-car displays and controls, better audio, better cameras, more control over drive modes and chassis settings, better materials all around (3-zone climate, a moonroof shade, no jagged Nissan-reject cargo cover, leather that doesnt instantly wrinkle upon purchase, a headliner that wont give you a carpet burn, ambient lighting that is actually color matched and customizable), a better mobile app, better sales and support experience. Polestar just isnt on BMW, Audi, or Mercedes level and Porsche is still just a dream. 

On the other end, you can rag on Tesla build quality all day, but theyre not $10-15K behind the Polestar and they ARE that much cheaper. And you can even the odds a lot against a Mach E or a Kia if you dont care that much for driving dynamics. 

Now, a lot of that is because Volvo/Polestar has to eat a uniquely higher import tariff, but thats their business problem to solve.  When equal or better products are available to the same customer for the same or less money, your product just wont compete on price. Simple as that. 

Owners choose Polestar because they want something different and want to encourage the good parts while hoping they iron out the bad, not because of value for money.",2023-08-09 00:56:26,"Why do people say the Polestar 2 is overpriced?




I have heard a lot of people say that the Polestar 2 is overpriced, but if you compare a similarly specced Polestar 2 to an BMW i4, the Polestar 2 is around 5 - 10k cheaper (ex. PS2 LRDM vs i4 xdrive 40 with similar options). The i4 is a larger car and has free EA charging still, which will account for something. Additionally, someone could make the argument that the BMW is a higher quality car (though I would say imo sentatec feels cheaper than weavetech and of course Nappa leather is better than the leather in the i4), but even then the price differential is more than enough to justify this. I am not saying the PS2 is better or worse than the i4, but if the i4 is not considered overpriced, then why would the PS2?

"Another issue with the EV market is that prices are primarily driven by the tech. As an actual vehicle? A model 3 is about as nice as a Dodge Neon. The Model S is barely better. 

Im in agreement with another poster here: while the i4 and Polestar 2 have nicer interiors than the model 3, they dont reach the standards of their ICE counterparts. Combine that with a subpar EV drivetrain and it feels like Im paying a premium not to buy a Tesla.

"Sadly people consider Tesla Model 3 and Y luxury for some reason and because those are top selling EVs they are always compared directly (which is truly ludicrous). I had a 2022 P2 that unfortunately got totaled and I replaced with a 2023 Model 3. There is literally no comparison quality wise (interior or exterior). You get what you pay for. My wife has a 2023 i4 and again, build wise, exterior and quality there is zero comparison to a 100% utilitarian Model 3 interior.  

I would gladly pay more for either the BMW i4 or Polestar P2. I will not be keeping the Tesla. Nothing wrong with it but no even comparable to either of those cars.

"Polestar 2 offers way better value for money than the i4.
While the i4 is longer, it's mainly lost to its long nose... The interior is not necessarily offering more space.

i4 comes with a higher capacity battery and higher peak charging speed, but in practice the charging shouldn't make a big difference as you rely on several factors.

Over here (NL), the i4 comes with silly small 17 inch rims, while the Polestar is as a minimum on 19 inch already. Also motorized and heated seats are options on the Beamer while standard on the P2.

Still both are beautiful cars, but I wouldn't say that the Polestar 2 is overpriced no. Even without packs it's already better specced than most competition.",2023-08-10 09:48:05,"Why do people say the Polestar 2 is overpriced?

"Polestar 2 LRDM in Thunder ($56,550), with pilot and plus ($2200) and leather ($5000): $64,150.

i4 xDrive in Skyscraper Grey ($62,250), with leather ($1500) premium package ($1900), driving assist ($1700) = $67,350. I misread the parking assist price as $700 and not $1700, so I grant you that the price difference is $3200 and not $2500. But I also missed the heads up display being included. There are also other options you could swap in for the leather or autopilot stuff, like laser headlights or a built-in dash cam or self-parking that you can't get at all in the Polestar.

As to your other comments, we can nickel and dime the comparison to death if you'd like, but the fact is that the BMW has the upper hand in range, materials, and equipment, and technology, and they're comparable in build quality, driving dynamics, and performance. There's no category where the Polestar is better than the BMW. So whether you think the BMW is a fair price or overpriced, the Polestar is *definitely* overpriced, especially when you bring the Mach E or an EV6 into the mix.

For the nits you picked:

* Both being HK means nothing--the BMW system has more speakers, a real subwoofer, and actual audio adjustment controls. It also has better road noise isolation and a different soundstage configuration.
* I agree with you that Nappa leather is more *expensive*, but  BMW offers four grades of leather, and Verasca and Nappa are the middle two. Their luxury option is Merino. Vernasca is a top grain leather with an embossed coating that is far more durable than the softer Nappa, which doesn't wear well. It's also only $1500 instead of $5000.  If your preference is to pay more for a leather that doesn't hold up over time, then okay. Personally, I'd rather have Audi or Mercedes leather over either of them, because theirs is a better balance.
* A $5 LED with a lensed logo compared to a sunroof that **opens** with a functioning, retractable glare shade is **not** comparable, sorry.
* The cargo cover is pressed felt with resin that will cut you up if you touch the edge, compared to the vinyl retractable covers in even the Volvo XC40. Polestar massively cheaped out there.
* Whether you think configurable ambient lighting is lame or not is irrelevant--per your leather standard, it's a more expensive part. Polestar didn't even bother to color match their white LEDs--they're set to 3 *different* color temperatures.

Additionally, someone could make the argument that the BMW is a higher quality car (though I would say imo sentatec feels cheaper than weavetech and of course Nappa leather is better than the leather in the i4), but even then the price differential is more than enough to justify this.

"There is definitely a quality difference between the TM3 and PS2 and i4, but I do not know if there is such a large difference between the PS2 and i4, such that the former would be overpriced but the latter not.

"The i4 has more speakers but the watt output for the PS2 system is higher. (600 vs 425) Regardless, its certainly not reasonable to compare the PS2 HK system to the base i4 system so the HK system should be optioned on the i4 as well.   
Objectively speaking Nappa is worth more and that is enough. (see: [https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/12/23/know-your-leather-here-are-the-different-types-of-bmw-leather-options/](https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/12/23/know-your-leather-here-are-the-different-types-of-bmw-leather-options/) )

If you think a moonroof and sunroof are not comparable thats up to you. I am not here to disregard opinions, only to find a like to like configuration that is actually realistic.   
According to a popular EV tester, Polestar's Pixel LEDs are superior to BMW's regular lights (see: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3pH8BdoTLg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3pH8BdoTLg) ). Additionally, in non- American markets, you need to get Laser to get adaptive highbeams. Since we are talking about the US market, we can ignore this and say that the Laser lights are not an upgrade to be added in a like to like comparison. Additionally, in the spirit of being reasonable, I will also ignore the fact that the PS2 comes with 19 inch rims vs the i4's 18's because such an upgrade on the i4 would be useless and not realistic.   


So, you forgot a few options such as the HK system, heated rear seats, and ventilated front seats.   
Additionally, the PS2 leather is $4000, and the extra thousand comes from the delivery cost. Therefore, your optioned PS2 with delivery comes out to as you said  $64,150.   
The i4 xdrive40 you optioned plus the HK system, heated rear seats, ventilated front seats, and the delivery cost comes out to $70,620.   
Therefore, the difference in price between a similarly optioned PS2 and i4 is around $6,500.   
The i4 has above the PS2: More range (307 vs 276), larger size, more premium built interior, a Heads up display, customizable ambient lighting, 2 years free EV charging

  
The PS2 has above the i4:  higher quality leather for the seats, better base headlights, and more power (hp and torque higher) 

Now, I am not saying that the PS2 is better or that the i4 is. I would just make the conjecture that in this list, the range the i4 has cancels with the power the PS2 has. Also, the more premium interior cancels with the higher quality leather. Also, better base headlights cancels out with heads up display and colored ambient lighting. This leaves 2 years free charging and the larger size. These two things are probably worth somewhere around $6,500. As such, my argument is that the PS2 and i4 are both priced comparatively for what they are, such that if one is overpriced, so is the other. If you think the i4 is better go ahead, I could not care less nor is it what I am arguing. If you disagree with my conjecture above, that is your right and I think I shall end here lol.

"I have a MY Performance and my wife just picked up a 2024 PS2 Performance. I like the seats better in her car. She did not get the Napa leather. I also like her sound system and that it has CarPlay. My car is faster, has more room, and a much better AC. I also have a few more little features that hers doesnt as far as I know like dog and camp modes, being able to set a max temp that the car can get to inside, the fact that the windows roll down slightly when you close the doors, etc. But nothing earth shattering. I havent had any quality issues with my Tesla for the year Ive had it. I think both are good but not great cars. Neither is a luxury car but both are premium. I do think the PS2 is overpriced to me for what you get overall vs the current cost of a Tesla M3 or MY but we were ok with paying the premium because my wife liked the size more and we didnt want to give Elon any more money. I realize the Elon stans will probably come for me now but whatever.

"I'll grant you the HK upgrade and the ventilated seats, which I thought was included in the upgrade packages.

The leather is simply a matter of taste. The cost differential is around $80 in materials.

The sunroof situation simply cannot be ignored. There are hundreds of dollars in additional parts required to have an articulating shade and an opening, functional roof. That's just not negotiable from a cost, functionality, or premium experience perspective.

I'm not getting into a subjective valuation opinion to ""cancel"" out anything, but on a pure cost basis, you've made some weird choices and one random YouTuber providing no direct comparison and no objective analysis about which headlights he ""likes"" more doesn't really carry any weight.

You're also leaving out a whole host of feature differences, such as 3-zone climate, larger displays, chassis tuning, improved diagnostics, better mobile app, sales/service/support infrastructure and customer experience, and frankly just better overall brand valuation and aftermarket support.

At the end of the day, if the cars were literally physical identical, you'd still expect the BMW to be a few thousand dollars more. The fact that that the Polestar is definitively and objectively behind in content **on top of that** is why the Polestar is notably poor value with US pricing compared to the BMW.

"A full-option EX30 is a nice package, and Ill admit Ive been debating one as my next company car.

Heres the issues with it, compared to the P2:

- Tesla-like controls: everything is on the touchscreen. Not as bad as some reviewers make it out to be, but some controls are a few menus deep.

- No HUD or digital cockpit: speed, consumption, etc, is all on the top half of the middle screen. Its nice and clear, but does take some getting used to - if ever.

- Small: dont underestimate how small the EX30 is. Two adults in front mean practically unusable rear seats. Or at least a pretty uncomfortable seating position for two other adults. The boot is fine for its size, but the P2 excels here (and its not as if its a big car either on the inside)

- Range: its very much a city car. Dont expect to pull more than 400kms out of the large battery on a good day. But, the 2023 P2 is the same - so no real change there.

Those are the big ones I can think of. Everything else is subject to your own preferences. The EX30 is well-built, but certain choices in terms of design are definitely made from a budget perspective.

"I wouldn't rule out EX30 for size - assuming it's efficiently packaged (like Bolt perhaps) it will give you way more usable space for the footprint than Polestar does, so overall usable space may not be all that different. Also the car shape may make the trunk space more practical as well. (I've done a full apartment move in a Bolt once, took quite a few trips but I'm pretty sure Polestar 2 would not have been any better for that, probably worse actually since couldn't have stacked as many boxes, so if EX30 is anything like Bolt then I wouldn't be too concerned about cargo space.)

The difference is probably mostly about driving experience. I doubt EX30 will be nearly as much of a ""driver's car"" as PS2. Personal preference if that's important to you.

I wouldn't be too worried about the ""city driver"" aspect personally. Both cars should be perfectly road trip capable if public charging infrastructure is sufficient.

"The cameras and Supercharging network are big deals though. 

I compared both during shopping and the P2's Infotainment was a huge difference. It is way, WAY, slower.  ""Hey Google"" is sick and powerful but dependant on internet, so spotty. Tesla's voice control doesn't do hotwords...but also does work offline.  Model 3 lacking a dashboard display isn't a huge deal, it is cool that AC can hit your face directly. The display on the model 3 has a LOT more area dedicated to app display. No carplay is a deal breaker to some, Spotify and maps seem much better on the model 3 simply due to display size. 

The P2 is taller and feels it. Performance package has better driving feel. P2 center console storage is much worse, rear hatch is much more usable. Normal glove boxes are better than ridiculous software controlled ones. Power Liftgate wasn't added to Model 3 until later years. 

 Model 3 has zero cooled seat options. 

Model 3 is faster per trim level in all trims. The P2 Performance should be faster than the Model 3 but Tesla under-rated the Model 3 a hair to better sell the Model 3 Performance. The Acceleration boost upgrade for the model 3 is more dramatic than the performance upgrade on the P2...but also bonkers pricing. A DMLR Model 3 with Acceleration boost is much faster than the fastest polestar 2. Model 3 performance is equal amounts faster than that. All three are too fast for an inexperienced driver. 

The Model 3 has better Autonomous driving features but does SOME dumb things. It really sucks at lanes splitting into multiple lanes. While the Model 3 has more capable 'autopilot' in whole, the pricing is absurdly expensive and not worth the money. Latest changes make it really intrusive. 

Polestar 2 build quality is much better than the Model 3. Model 3 Highland has a quiet ride than both.",2024-02-09 19:05:40,"Anyone here switch from a Model 3 to a Polestar 2?

"I had a Model 3 2021. Quality issues from day 1 (paint, rust, gaps, noise, breaking parts etc)
Didnt like the rear hatch. 
Back seat uncomfortable for adults on long drives. Wish it had more physical controls for wipers, lights, climate. Noisy, uncomfortable ride. 
Didnt like the UI changes in some OTA updates that took away shortcuts. Constantly changing features, not always for the better. Automatic wipers never works.

-> Polestar 2 2024 seems much better built. Looks better.
Ride feels more quiet (I measured it) and smoother (19 inch wheels). 
Better rear seats despite tunnel and better trunk hatch. 
Semi electric tow hook is convenient. 
Better and stronger lights (matrix). 
Android Auto is working well. 
Google assistant. 
Stores seat position for at least 4 users on the screen (havent tried adding more)
Each user can have different apps and accounts for google, spotify, Netflix, youtube etc (could only have 1 spotify account in the Tesla).
Easier to use screen while driving (bigger UI buttons is easier to tap without looking at the screen too much).
Normal window frames.
Normal doorhandles (with lights in them as a bonus).
Better cruise control. Pilot assist might not steer as well as Autopilot in all situations, but works well on freeway/highway, and reactivates automatically when changing lanes.

Charge port is manually opened so it doesnt close before Im done inserting the charger, and It has a release button so I dont have to use the app or enter the car to release charger.

What do I miss? 
App had more functionality, but I only miss the ability to change maximum charge percentage from my phone. Hope they add it!

The dashcam was a nice feature, as well as Sentry Mode, but Sentry mode sucked a lot of battery when used for longer periods. 

Charging network is open to all in EU.

Even though my P2 had a hatch, it was tiny inside and of course the cupholder situation was hideous. The Model 3 charging, mapping and integration was years ahead of my P2. I can clearly read a lot of fake anti Tesla narratives to support Polestar and it expected and as someone who leased both, its pretty clear who has real experiences with both cars and who doesnt. I'm in a leased Ioniq 5 now and it is light years ahead of the Polestar 2 is almost every area and is defintely built better than both cars.

- I didnt like the trunk from Tesla because of the limited loading height. This is way better at the Polestar

Hi guys,

I am about to take the plunge and complete ordering a Polestar 2. I test drove the RWD model, and I liked it very much. I have reserved the AWD one, with the PIlot and Plus pack, since I have been determined that I really want AWD on my next EV car.

The only concern now is that I am still a bit undecided if I should have ordered one with the Performance pack? A topic discussed many times, but I am stil not sure. The price difference is around \~ 6600 USD. 

I think the brakes are not worth it. Not sure about the dampers either. Not sure about the wheels. The car I have configured now is delivered with 19"" wheels. More rubber is probably good for durability and driving in the winter? I live in a Scandinavian country with varying conditions.

However, I do enjoy a responsive car and having a little fun when driving. I am surely going to buy the Performance software upgrade. Maybe this is enough since I even liked the RWD version? Or would you say that the difference in car with the Performance pack vs. Dual Motor + Performance upgrade is quite noticable?",Reddit
"As the salesman told me at the space when I was going through the same thinking as you:
Unless you absolutely want it or you will drive your car on a track, don't take the performance.

The ride is stiffer, you won't ever use the break for what they were built for and you will probably not notice the difference in power on daily rides.

If it's for the aesthetic, like I was considering myself, you must ban chocolate in the car as any trace of it on the yellow seatbelts will never leave. Definitely the kind of details I was not thinking about.

I will receive mine on the 20th this month and opted for a LRSM with pilot and plus packs in the end.",2023-12-02 20:43:26,"Polestar 2 Performance pack

"- The infotainment system is super responsive. A friend who drives a Porsche Macan recently went on a road trip with me, and he mentioned how much more responsive my screen was than his.
- I have the ventilated seats. Id say theyre a nice to have rather than a necessity. They work well, through.
- You can use Waze via Android Auto or Apple CarPlay, and itll show on the full infotainment screen (but I believe not on the instrument cluster, which can only display the native Google navigation).
- The Harman Kardon audio system is good, not great. Premium but not best-in-class compared to, say, the Bowers & Wilkins system in Volvos or the AKG systems in Cadillacs.
- Ive only done calls while plugged in for Apple CarPlay, and it works just fine.
- Cameras are crisp. The Pilot pack has 360-degree cameras which I really love (the overhead 360 view isnt best-in-class IMHO but does the trick).

Do you know if there is any UI redesign on the way? Or is it possible to install or sideload different themes on it? Have they ever done a redesign in the past?
* Does anyone have the ventilated seats? I wanted to know your experience with them and if they're worth getting?
* Does the dashboard navigation only work with Google Maps or is Waze also supported?
* How is the sound quality with the plus pack upgraded speakers?
* How is the sound quality when having a handsfree phone call?
* How are the cameras? Are they good quality and clear enough to manoever with? Which angles can you see and can you access them at any time while driving?

" The center console sometimes needs a minute to warm up in the winter (its usually much colder here than in Belgium though), but its decently snappy once its there. 

 The UI/UX is pretty good to do its primary function, which is switching easily between a handful of (customizable) apps *while driving*. The gear shifter is there to rest your wrist on to hold your finger steady, and the app icons are huge and easy to hit with a glance. The orange and black and white in Helvetica is high contrast, and easy to process. Even if I could side load something else, I wouldnt want to. 

 We almost got the ventilated seats, but went with the Weavetech instead, for durability, ease of cleaning dog hair and kid mess, and (see above) cold weather. Saved a bunch this way too. 

 Others have answered about Apple Maps in the binnacle, and I couldnt tell you about Waze there. I prefer Google Maps anyhow. In general, maps under the steering wheel were a huge selling point, and help you keep your eyes on or near the road. 

 The sound for music is great. I think the Bowers & Wilkins in the 3 and the EX-90 will be better, but the H&K in the 2 is solid. 

 Phonecalls overhead are stellar, on both ends, with just a Bluetooth connection. 

 Cameras are lackluster, though the 360 birds-eye view is quite useful. 

The Polestar 2 is a drivers car, first and foremost. The UI/UX is, soup to nuts, there to be useful to someone focused on and enjoying *driving*. Theres a fair dash of practicality too.",2024-02-02 00:21:45,"Questions about Polestar 2

"1. Center console neither laggy or snappy. Startup might take a while but once its up and running is more than adequate is responsiveness. *note: I am a rather impatient person*

2. No UI redesign.

3. Yes theyre worth it. Its more energy economical *and* feels better having the seat blow cool air in full power with the AC at even low power on hot days than say just blowing the AC at high power. I loved mine.

4. Waze also supported, just not as nice.

5. Sounds is good. Im not a keen audiophile when it comes to car audio but I didnt sense any awkward peaking or shallowness in any sound level. Just say its nothing too fancy, but more than acceptable for a car of that price.

6. Hands free is alright. You will have to talk a little louder though.

Got it into the dealer and they informed me (after being at the dealer for 4 weeks) that there were chewed wires on the sensor.

"Just two comments: 
I went for the leather in my my22 and am so happy I did. It makes the car seem more premium (/ normal). I just didn't like the interior with any of the other materials (as innovative as they are). I like it so much better with leather (but my kids are grown and I don't have pets to transport, two important conditions for the other materials which may suit those needs better). The ventilation is excellent in hot weather. 

I'll disagree with the post that says the HK is viewed as very good. With a bunch of tweaking  settings, you can get it to sound decent enough; note this will require a high quality audio stream for that (I use YouTube music on high quality; Sirius can't come close on audio quality; others use lossless streaming on Apple music with carplay, or other solutions). They've made improvements (and a new car takes 6-8 weeks for speakers to really brake in, at first it sounds horrible) so I'd give it a B+ at this point. But as many have pointed out, it's missing clarity in the midrange and the subwoofer adjustment seems like it doesn't do anything. The rear speakers are notoriously low output but that seems to be a design choice. I set mine on full surround (which most don't but I really like) and set to driver focus .. this all seems to give the best sound stage for my taste. The car is small so that limits how much can really be done imo. I enjoy the audio experience, partly because the voice integration with YouTube music is very good and their catalog is huge so the benefits there somewhat offset the less than stellar audio. Ps set out to make the audio decent, but it's not high end and won't blow you away. On new models, I think they're going with W&B, which might need in reaction to the market comments on the HK (which I think was designed with HK people). Don't get me wrong, the HK audio is decent, just not stellar.",2024-01-19 11:27:29,"Considering used Polestar 2

* Seats: Looks like cloth in the PP model, and leather in the non-PP. Are the seats in both ventilated--or is that only a feature on the leather? I've always had leather seats in my volvos and generally think I'd prefer leather, but maybe these cloth seats aren't bad?
* Anything to look for when I go up for a test drive? Its 80 miles away for me. My research so far says these cars are pretty reliable and there aren't many issues that software updates haven't fixed. 
* Is it worth waiting to find MY22 cars at this price? Any fixed teething issues? Is the heatpump (my22+ only right?) really worthwhile? It'll be my daily driver for a \~50 mile commute. Garage or driveway parked. We've got other vehicles we'll take for road trips as the wife prefers something larger our family of 4 road trips.

"Launch edition PP isn't any faster. They figured some more stuff out on the later models after more R&D, 2023+ performance pack is faster. Any dual motor launch edition is eligible for a one time $1200 OTA update to increase max motor output from 408hp/487lb-ft to 476hp/502lb-ft. It also gives a more aggressive throttle mapping and launch control.

PP has stiffer suspension of very high quality. You will feel the road very well, unfortunately that includes potholes.

Leather is ventilated nappa. The weavetech seats are very good, however non-ventilated. They don't really get dirty, don't overheat or freeze you, and they're comfortable.

If the car is on the most recent software update, it'll likely be very solid, as you've seen. 

MY22 heat pump is probably only worth it if you don't charge in the garage or take long drives in extreme cold. It will likely have minimal effect in the US south.

The HK sound is contentious by default, but generally very well liked after the equalizer is tweaked around. It really shines at high volume.",2024-01-19 10:33:30,"Considering used Polestar 2

"Both cars look to be good deals. No idea on the dealer, but bring your waders and prepare to haggle back to the listed prices.


The performance pack downsides are minimal and really only show up much, MUCH later in the cars life. I.e the shock need rebuilding or you need to buy brake pads/rotors. Each of these will be much more expensive than the standard setup. The Moon car has the optional 20-inch non performance pack wheels, which -in my experience - ride worse than the performance and the base 19inch wheels. So tires will cost the same to replace across both cars, but the performance rims are forged, so better able to handle potholes.


Only the leather is ventilated. I have heard of complaints about the weavetech seats (non leather) not being breathable. That is something i would consider if i lived farther south. Volvo leather is high quality, but 'breaks in' quickly(wrinkles) and you have to watch for blue jeans transfer. Keeping the leather looking new will be more work than the weavetech.


On the test drive, check the software version. You want one reasonably up-to-date, 2.13. Too far behind and you need to take it to a space/dealer to get it updated. Which is a PITA.


2022s did get the heat pump if the car has the glass roof (easiest way to ID a plus package), but most of the 22s ive seen do not have the pilot pack (look for fog lights) and therefore dont have the better cruise control options, which i think would be nice on a highway commute.


The sound system is the weirdest of any car ive been in. Sounds fine, is much better at high volume, but all the sound comes from the front. Its not broken, and has an actual EQ you can adjust to get the most out of it.",2024-01-19 13:32:01,"Considering used Polestar 2

"\- The PP isn't any faster (barring having the software update pre-installed in some years). If all you care is stoplights and quarter mile than just having the AWD is enough. Maybe faster at a track, especially breaking after pushing it hard.

\- The cloth seats aren't bad.

\- Turn the sound system off and listen to clicking nose from the rear axle (not relays clicking in the center console, that's normal)

\- Hard to answer about heatpump, but it's a great commuter.

"I recently went through this. Downsides to PP, some people arent ready for how stiff it rides even on the softest setting. The 20 wheels often get beat up and downsizing to 19 seems limited or impossible due to large calipers. No heat pump on 21 and Im convince the range is a bit worse over a random AWD variant. To be clear, the efficiency is bad on all of them except RWD, but there is no chance Ill ever hit EPA even in the summer driving like a granny on city roads.

Seats are personal preference. Im done with leather for a while as I dont like the way it wears, you have to baby it, then it still wrinkles and sags. Also probably a good 30 years until a tan leather interior speaks to me. If it were black or neutral light I might consider.

Make sure all keys are present or missing removed since this will be an added expense later. Check for a charging cable if you dont already have one. If software is too far behind youll need to visit a dealer to update. Same as any other vehicle - press every button and feature, try to look for repairs, ask if any repairs were done by them before listing.

HK is fine IMO and Im glad to have it. Whether it sucks or not for the price is irrelevant, there is no better option but there is a worse one. If you arent willing to dump a few weekends and/or thousands into tweaking it, then HK is a perfectly reasonable choice. I have had legitimately terrible HK audio in other vehicles so I get it, but audio is so subjective that you need to test it yourself.",2024-01-19 14:34:27,"Considering used Polestar 2

"Unpopular opinion: I actually like the idea of keeping the transmission tunnel and using it to position the battery modules. The more that can sit like this, the fewer have to be on the skateboard platform under the driver and so the seating position can be lower. I actually think it's a smart design choice.

P2 and Model 3 are the only EVs I've sat in with low seating positions that I like. Not sure how Tesla does it, but from my understanding, the P2 puts them in the middle instead of under the driver.

If it's a big sit high SUV it doesn't matter but I'd take the mild inconvenience of a centre hump to have a lower, sportier seating position.",2023-10-29 16:12:42,"2025 Polestar 2

Now my argument is mainly with the substandard software. Tesla's proprietary software is convenient and always works. I'll list a few that I find better than other EVs in general.

\- in depth charge usage / driving style analysis which considers both and calculates journeys based on it.

\- apps are just installed. Netflix / YouTube. You don't need to install 3rd party apps.

\- the AC system is the best I've used on a screen. I usually prefer physical buttons but Tesla's UI is exceptional.

\- Tesla's auto drive - a clear advantage. They have the data. This also helps with cleaning windows and putting on double lights. I've never had a need to use the stalk. Also puts it in drive or reverse depending on the position of the car when it's parked.  - sentry mode  - in the plaid with the yolk wheel, there is no stalks. Only buttons on the wheel.

Now my argument is mainly with the substandard software. Tesla's proprietary software is convenient and always works. I'll list a few that I find better than other EVs in general.

\- in depth charge usage / driving style analysis which considers both and calculates journeys based on it.

\- apps are just installed. Netflix / YouTube. You don't need to install 3rd party apps.

\- the AC system is the best I've used on a screen. I usually prefer physical buttons but Tesla's UI is exceptional.

\- Tesla's auto drive - a clear advantage. They have the data. This also helps with cleaning windows and putting on double lights. I've never had a need to use the stalk. Also puts it in drive or reverse depending on the position of the car when it's parked.  - sentry mode  - in the plaid with the yolk wheel, there is no stalks. Only buttons on the wheel. Since you don't really need the stalks. Future Tesla's will also remove the stalks. A smart move imo

"It's a compromise and a design decision.  Tesla tried (ans succeeded) to make very efficient EV, and did their best to keep the weight down.  The M3P is still quicker than the EV6 GT and Polsetar 2 with performance package, even though it has less powerful motors.  But we have to deal with sparse interiors, less soundproofing and more body shop repairs if aluminum panels are damaged.  To keep the weight down, they built a car that feels cheaper.

Polestar was willing to sacrifice come performance, range and efficiency to built a really quiet car with a solid interior with better materials.  And that's fine too.  There are a lot of people that prefer that for a daily driver.  My wife certainly does and she loves the Polestar 2.",2023-08-31 14:04:13,"Polestar vs Tesla

When I bought my PS2 the Ioniq wasn't a thing. When I started seeing pics and videos of them though they piqued my interested even though I had a pretty new Polestar at that point. It looked nice, had some nice things that I appreciated and I started wondering if I'd made a mistake.

Jump forward a few months later and I get to look at an Ioniq up close and personal... and I don't like it. While it's definitely a premium for Hyundai, the interior materials aren't even close to as good as the Polestar's. While the interior looked great in pictures in real life it just seemed too much like a toy and not enough like a serious car. As for the exterior, this is one of those rare cars that I think looks much better in pictures. In person I find the rear of the car in particular awkward and overly busy and just seems to bulge in the wrong places. 

I'm glad I made the choice to go with the Polestar; I can already tell I would've been disappointed with the Hyundai.",2023-09-28 22:00:42,"Polestar 2 and ioniq 6

"I was in the same boat and went for polestar but it depends on what you are looking from a car. 

I would say if you want high quality build like in a Volvo and a luxurious interior I think polestar is better but if you want a bit larger and spacious interior it is ioniq 6.  As for the cargo space I think polestar is better with hatchback design 

As for the ride I felt like ioniq has a better ride if you are looking for smooth rides how ever polestar has more fun and agile ride. If you go to performance pack you can change the settings (manually) of your damper to make it. More comfortable. 

For me ioniq felt a bit cheep  specially for the interior quality and I think with the asking price they needed to do better on that. To much hard plastic and feel like a 20-25k Hyundai (Elentra)

The P2 is much quieter and the interior is nicer but that's literally where the greener grass stops!

This car is horrible with efficiency and charges very slowly, the mirrors randomly change where they were set to, the mirrors get stuck in the closed position like 2-4 times a day, the sound system starts to static and a soft reset is needed 2 times a day, the regen braking is way too aggressive, apple carplay is basically an app on top of the Android Auto built into the car and doesn't work on the driver display just the center screen and the pilot plus is absolute trash. The pilot plus almost caused 3 different accidents. It literally snatches the wheel from you and for no reason it tried to make me cross the lane line into oncoming traffic just 3 days ago. It randomly stops detecting cars in front of you and starts to speed up and you have to brake to keep from hitting the car you're following.

Most cars do have trunk opening on the fob but most cars dont have self raising gas pistons. Thats why popping the trunk is a thing because it pops up but you still have to lift it. There are of course many cars that dont have them for a variety of reasons the manufacturer decides. All cars Ive owned from 2006 forward however have had a trunk unlock button. Im sure theres some kind of metric out there to point us all in the right direction in any case.,2023-09-08 11:52:54,"Polestar 2 KeyFob is the worst

"Its a good family car when you have only one child. Cargo space is big enough, you can put six german beer crates in it. Only problem is the hight of the cargo space and the automatic door. Sometimes some luggage needs to be put on the front passenger seat. We are happy with the car as a family car and our child was 2 as we start using the polestar 2 as a family car.

"P2 is not the ultimate family car for a young family, but it's better than the Tesla Model 3. 

Back seats will fit a child seat perfectly. It has isofix in all 5 seating positions. 

Polestar cargo room is 1 meter deep and wide (40 inch). Height is from 45 to 71 cm (17-28 inch). Smaller than the Tesla Model 3 but much more usable because of the hatchback. 

Perfect room for strollers and kids stuff. 

I googled pictures of the Bugaboo. I'm pretty sure that stroller will fit perfectly, with room for the 7 days worth of diapers, clothing, and accessories your wife will be packing for the 4 hour visit at her moms. 

But the Bugaboo seems to be able to fit in a Miata

"Top Gear aptly describes it as ""The most complete EV.""

It doesn't really do anything the best. Build quality or looks maybe, but it does everything pretty well and without gimmicks.

Pros:

Excellent build quality 

Top tier safety

Powerful (just under 500hp)

Stylish

2024's have massive range 

Handles well

Heavy, wide stance

Has great ground clearance

ADAS systems are useful and intuitive. The 360 camera is a godsend and pilot Assist is seamless

The hatch is extremely useful

Cons:

Up until recently, Polestar was still figuring out their software. Cars on older software releases may need frequent infotainment resets until updated.

A bit pricey in the US due to the import tariff

Numerically small cargo capacity

Relatively inefficient at high speed due to the strong shape 


Other notes:

It needs to be sat in before committing. The interior is numerically spacious, but the F16-like cockpit doesn't appeal to some. Others like myself love it.

In regards to service, Polestar will pick the car up for you if any major issues occur, as well as provide or pay for a loaner. They've come 300 miles for a friend of mine who adopted early when issues were more prevalent. I've had no issues in my ownership.

It's also worth note that fully loaded launch editions with sub 10k miles are in the mid to low $30k range right now.

Edit: Spelling",2023-08-28 20:14:52,"Considering Polestar 2




Im considering a Polestar 2 and am wondering what everybodys pros and cons are. Also, the closest dealer seems to be 400 or so miles away is it a bad idea to have one without a local dealer?",Reddit
"Pros 

\- in my opinion by far the best looking EV in its class. Depending on the color and rims this car actually looks like a normal car and not some weird space ship like many other electric cars out there (unless you want a stormtrooper car and go for a a white polestar with those horrible white rims, I forgot what those are called). 

\- great to drive and very nice handling, I had a Volvo v40 and I felt right at home. 

\- I personally haven't had any major issues with it since I got it in January, you will hear a lot of horror stories here though obviously. 

\- very easy to use display and it works fast and well. 

\- heavy government subsidies (especially here in Germany, especially as a company car, like it is in my case) 

\- all in all much less complicated and pleasant experience than what I expected from my first electric car. I am positively surprised.

Cons: 

not Polestar specific, but obviously range and charging can be a bit of a hassle, as with any EV. It takes some time to get used to if this is your first EV. I live in Germany and I feel like we aren't very EV friendly yet. Could be different wherever you are from. We don't have that many charging stations but still manage to have  lots of different types of charging stations, different apps are needed for each, its common that they don't work or the app doesn't work or the charging spots are blocked by non EVs or Evs that aren't charging. 

\- My car does seem to have a few growing pains, nothing major really but still stuff you wouldn't really expect from a car of this price category. The windows are squeeky when they go up and down, sometimes stuff like bluetooth won't work, or other features (usually fixed when you turn the car off and back on or resetting the console). 

\- my biggest  and probably only real complaint / disappointment is the pilot package tbh. Lots of features that are kind of inconsistent in how well they work. My apartment complex has a pretty tight parking garage and this car is a beeping festival in tight spaces. Front, Back, sides, everything has sensors that sometimes work really well and sometimes don't seem to work at all. Same goes for the visuals on the camera.   So I can't really rely on those I feel..,which is annoying because the car is considerably bigger than my v40 was. 

Break assist systems have given me a heart attack several times. While reversing out of tight spaces the car peeps at everything, sometimes it thinks you are about to back into something even though nothing is there and it does a  full on emergency break. 

Lane assist is also scary as hell in some situations, the car seems to be pretty bad at keeping in lanes and the cruise control is a bit wonky too. Several times on the autobahn the car has suddenly started to break by itself in slight left turns because it thought a truck in the right lane ahead of me was actually in my lane.  This also happens occasionally on normal roads and the break assistance systems kick in without any real threat.

Hello Polestars. I have a Tesla Model 3 Performance (2020) via work and have loved it.

I am very interested in the 4. Anyone moved from Model 3 to one of the other models (appreciate this one is geely based) and have any feedback? 

Also, specifically, will the Polestar 4 have senty/a dashcam recording feature? Spec ominously silent. This is great on the Tesla and I'll miss it if there is no ability to plug in a tiny thumb drive to record.

"Im gonna be honest with you, I was shopping P2 and drove a 22 AWD base and a 21 PPP. Both cars were nice, they felt a lot like my XC40 in quality, notably the PPP, the base AWD felt a bit cheaper. I was always a Tesla hater due to the Elon problem. 

Then I drove a Model 3. The base little details are not as comparable. Visibility is much better in the Model 3 DMLR, the suspension feels like a split between the Performance pack and normal P2, the model 3 dual motor is faster and feels it, the P2 weight gain is felt.  The interior quality gap isnt as big as I expected it to be. My biggest surprise was that the P2s software sells an idea that the car doesnt cash. Third party apps are kinda a flop still and the Tesla has a Spotify app that is actually good without needing to resort to CarPlay. Honestly I would take the big screen Spotify experience over swipe down, swipe down,  swipe down on CarPlay.  The Tesla map software is good. Better than Sensus for sure, not Google Maps..but it honestly feels like using modern Apple Maps, which is still pretty good. Then you have all the weirder stuff like sentry, dashcam, and the ease of one button to keep the interior the same temp when I go into the store and my wife stays in the car. (That was rather frustrating in the P2, short of using the App, I didnt see a way.) As much as Im meh about it allI bought the Model 3 on Monday.

"I chose the PS2 because it seems more upscale, a bit more of a sport Sedan.  A big plus for me is that you do not see yourself at every intersection.   That said, I totally agree that the tech features in the Tesla are far superior.  I can also see how the typical Camry owner would prefer the ride, space, and charging network of the Tesla.  An Alfa owner (and those are rare) would take the PS2.

I think they are both great cars, each with pros and cons.   I do think that even with the current P2 platform, that Polestar could  significantly close the gap by refreshing the software (both the app and in car) and tech.    I doubt the P2 will ever see a less bulky center console or a 2nd cupholder.

The room is completely white floor, walls, ceiling. Perfectly lit. Only thing in the room is my car, a small bench and a small table. The car was hand washed, not a speck of dust anywhere. The room was perfectly lit, enhancing every design feature of the car perfectly.

Turned up bang on time, about 10 minutes into the delivery slot, on the day I had been given. Arrived in a closed lorry and was carefully offloaded and parked on my drive.

The delivery guy even mentioned some places they've seen problems (door seals, boot carpet) so I could make sure not to miss anything.

I live about just over 40 miles from Bicester where my nearest 'space' (and their UK HQ is) and I have seen on the forums that if you're less than about 30 miles they will sometimes drive it to you. I don't think they use the Volvo dealer network here, except for servicing.

"If this is going to be a family car you shouldnt sacrifice practicality or cargo space. We have a 3yr old and test drove the P2 (2021) and the EV6 (2022). Keep in mind that the P2 was before all the cool software updates, so it lacked Apple CarPlay and there were still issues with the TCAM.

While the P2 was fun to drive, the trunk was quite small and unpractical, although a hatchback. The interior quality was a notch under Volvo (we had a 2018 V60 Inscription at the time). Range wise the P2 was also under the EV6. And it still charges slower. The EV6 drives surprisingly good for the size and shape, so the Ioniq 5 shouldnt be that bad either.

Your kid is 1. Youre still going to carry a stroller and toys, so keep that in mind. I hate to have to carry luggage in the car rather than in the trunk.",2023-03-26 08:47:39,"Polestar 2 vs. Ioniq 5?

"I have had the Mach-E for a year now, and had the P2 for 6 months before that.  Everything is doable in the P2, it's just much easier in the Mach-E.  The P2 doesn't have much space width wise, so even with Diono car seats, it'll be hard to fit a person in between two car seats.  More doable in the Mach-E (need Diono seats or something slim though).  The problem with the P2's rear seats is the door and the shape of the opening makes it hard to load and unload kids, especially if you can't open it past the first notch.  When my kid was 4 years old, she was able to climb into the Mach-E on her own, she couldn't do it in the P2.

Cargo space is not even close, Mach-E has double the space on paper, and the slope of the P2's hatch makes it hard to utilize the whole space.  Again, still doable in the P2 and we made it work, but everything was just easier in the Mach-E.  The passengers in the front and rear all had more space and were more comfortable.  I miss driving the P2 everyday, it was so much fun, but for family purposes, the P2 is a compromise.",2023-03-26 15:35:42,"Polestar 2 vs. Ioniq 5?

The Maxi one is way thicker so it takes up more space, but regardless you're going to have a hard time fitting a full sized adult in the middle of the seats. The infant rear facing seat will likely hit the back of the front seat for whatever side you put it on, although it did that on my XC60 too so that might just be life.",2023-03-26 15:18:17,"Polestar 2 vs. Ioniq 5?

When I got the car, we had full Diono car seats (functioning as boosters) - the only caveat I'd say would be if you have rear-facing car seats, I can see that the space would be annoying (but the space was even annoying in my prior XC60 and XC90, so that's really not a knock).

I mean, you're talking about a lowered sports car here. Pretty much any Cayman, GR86, MX-5 will fulfill all of your requirements (except the ""cage feel"", you'd get away from that in a 911 but that's a whole different price level).

"I have both a c40 and a P2. They are very similar in their build but totally different in their driving characteristics and feel. C40 is bigger inside and feels more open. We have two kids so rear seat space for car seats was a must and everything fits in both, so you should be fine with a dog. Rear seats also do fold down so you wanted to do the bed thing back there you'd have a lot of room since both are really hatchbacks. 

Build quality is great in both. I'd had other Volvos and everything feels nice and solid. We didn't get leather for the P2 and I don't regret that at all. P2 feels and drives more like a sports car. You are in a cockpit with the center console boxing you in. Also one cup holder unless you open center arm rest. My wife drives the P2 and she constantly comments on the cup holder but yet somehow doesn't want to trade, if that says anything. P2 is slightly faster and definitely corners better than the C40. C40 has more headroom and trunk space just by virtue of being taller. Also the ride height is taller and the layout is more open. I don't feel boxed in like the P2. I also have more cup holders. I honestly would drive either one, love them both. P2 had a few issues with reading the key but my he reset software update seems to be doing well. Also P2 has a real phone as key whereas with the C40 I can just unlock or start the car. 

Range wise, P2 seems to be more efficient, but we're talking 20 miles. With new updates efficiency in both seems to milder increase, but frankly I never drive 200 miles in a day so no big deal. We also have a 240v home charger we share. 

Finally, if you do have issues with your P2, you can take it to any Volvo dealer, not just the space one. It's really just a Volvo on the inside. I mean that literally, even the TCAM parts are stamped Volvo. I think polestar has a divergent software build but also they share common coding. P2 has a way better App Store option though, still trying to figure out why I only get Tubi and my wife gets all sort of extras.

Anyway, I would drive either one, they are both great and both have upsides depending on what you're looking for. I liked riding higher and the rear on the Volvo is way cooler to me, so I went with that. Wife likes the speed and looks of the polestar, so that's hers. I would have driven the polestar no problem if she wanted to switch.",2023-01-31 17:18:17,"Considering Polestar 2




Hey all.  Im going full electric for the first time and had pretty much narrowed down to C40 after they announced the upcoming 2024 changes (increased mileage which is huge for that model, and the RWD bias for dual motor).  These are coming to the Polestar also. I do have a Fisker Ocean reserved also. 

The C40 and Fisker (and 2024 Polestar) wont be available to me until later in the year, maybe much later. But I could probably get my hands on a 23 Polestar when Im ready next month.  

Sothoughts on waiting for those others vs a 23 Polestar AWD now? Mileage needs are definitely over the current C40 for long range, but I *think* the PS would work if its truly upwards of 260mi.  Also I dont care about the grill change so no need to mention that. 

Nearest Polestar dealer is about 120 miles away. Worried about that.

"Hmm... I didn't see any official announcements for the C40/XC40 yet, but it's interesting the articles mention the Dual Motor versions get a larger battery pack. The US version of the 2 only gets the bigger pack on the Single Motor version, so the range of the dual won't be that much higher than the 23 (\~10 miles is the official estimate). It'll probably be a little better at prolonged highway speeds though, if that matters.

There's still a lot that's unknown about the '24 models, so there could be some interior/component changes that would be nice, but if range is important, I'd probably opt for the C40 if it indeed has the new 82kWh pack in the Dual Motor version. If \~260 is ok, the '23 P2 is a good option.

FWIW, when I got my car the closest space was 140 miles away. There's one closer (\~50 miles), but I've only had to go in for a few OTA updates and my 2yr service.",2023-01-31 19:41:34,"Considering Polestar 2

"I am coming from a full bolt on GTI (~320 HP at ~2,800 lbs).  I have had 3 BMWs including a ZHP (which I never should have sold). 

The Polestar is definitely closer to the ZHP than the GTI.  You can't throw the Polestar into corners with abandoned and pull it out with the front wheels.  So it doesn't handle like a sports coupe.

But it does pull.  I have the dual motor, so lots of HP, and of course, immediate (no turbo lag) and all across the band.  On ramps and acceleration on the highway are outstanding.

I don't have the performance pack, so just the base suspension.  It is tight.  Great for winding roads (more than switchbacks).  And it's smooth.  I can feel the weight,  but the car stays planted and when the all seasons wear out I'll put summer tires on.

Getting in and out of the GTI was getting tougher.  The wife didn't like the GTI, too low, too small, 2 doors.  This car is great for sporty country drives and fun passing moments.

Also, Iove that I can drive it like I stole it for a few hours, up into the mountains, down through the valleys, along the rivers, and come home and ""fill 'er up"" for $8.",2023-12-28 23:55:19,"Just had a polestar 2 for 6 days

"Not gone, just out for dinner and then sleep Ill try to cover all my answers here. 

No, def not trolling. I genuinely wanted to like it. And I think its probably not specific to the polestar as people have said I think my expectations of ev were wrong. 

Interior is a very nice to be. Volvos are good cars. 

It was a hertz car so assuming it was quite base spec and given the understeer and scrabbling for traction in the front wheels I can only assume it was a single motor version. 

Track car - what more info do you need? I mentioned it to show that I have some idea about how cars handle. Ive driven in a lot of circuits in the uk, and one in the us. I wasnt expecting it to be as sprightly as my turbo mx5, but i wasnt expecting the dreadful ride that thumped and clunked its way along uk roads. 

Previous cars. The fact that they are mostly estate cars doesnt really have anything to do with it. They were all premium fast family cars. The Audis were a little understeery (to say the least) but all of them were more compliant and have more feedback (again Audi steering not great). 
I guess the sq5 is the closest to the polestar form factor - crossover type of thing. 

Ive had a Tesla model 3 for a few days before as well. That was a better ride until you got to any sort of limit (and I dont mean crazy driving, just pressing on a bit) and then it completely fell over. It was dreadful. 

I still want to try another one to make sure it wasnt the car - but it only had 15k miles on it. I also want to try the performance version as I think they have trick hlins (?).
I also want to try something like a taycan. 

I think it might just be that EVs are heavy and there is not a lot thats going to make it a pleasant car to drive.",2023-12-29 07:04:15,"Just had a polestar 2 for 6 days

2 weeks ago I bought a CPO from Polestar Marin.
I spent some time looking around at non CPO, and CPOs. The Costco $1000 incentive, and CPO terms tipped the scale. I ended up getting a 2021 CPO with PPP for $35k 15,xxx miles. Car looked to be in great shape, clean Carfax and all. 

As i have been driving a couple issues popped up, the right front is rattling, there is a rattle behind the dash, and the left tail light always has condensation in it. 

 I have service scheduled for the end of January. I asked them to pick up the car since its a long drive, but they will not pick up the car for service.
I have to drive over 60miles to get it serviced. The polestar website says they pick up and deliver with in 150miles. but the service point will only do that with in 20 miles. 

Also, a few days ago while washing the car I noticed there was body repair done to the drivers door. I can see the sanding marks and in the right angle the finish isnt as smooth as the rest of the car.  Also the rear bumper has a small droplet of clear coat formed where more body repair was done. The body damage was not on the carfax. Contacted Marin and was told they rely on the carfax and this wouldnt fall under any warranty claim.

Yea I missed seeing the body damage repair the day I picked up the car, not a big issue but also dont want that to affect warranty. 

Just posting so others that buy CPOs are a bit more thourough than I was before purchase. 

Other than that, the car is nice and has way more power than I need, range is perfect for my work commute. 124mile round trip and I get back with 30% charge left. I have a Chargepoint Home flex that is hardwired and puts out the 11k and 48amps with out issue.",Reddit

"See this is interesting obviously teslas 3 offerings arent a perfect 1:1 match with PSs but high level:

**Pros from Tesla**: charging speed and peak curve, heat pump as standard (I believe Tesla has this on all trims but fact check me in that), interior practicality layout (specifically the center console area) polestars is really laughable for me here. I drove it for a week and had to find like a specific thin water bottle just to fit in the door bins, front hood auto/remote open, crash camera system, blind spot cameras, no central drive shaft tunnel compromising space in the back seat, usable frunk (yes I hear that customers dont use the frunk but thats likely because most auto makers treat it like a manual hood instead of an extra storage space so people are less likely to go through the effort to open it just to access the small amount of space thats offered) 

**Pros from Polestar**: looks obviously like literally top to bottom its a thing of beauty, trunk cargo area is great and lift back makes it very functional, adjustable springs (though the manual springs on the performance spec is . Not ideal to say the least) , the instrument binnacle (love how its embedded in the dash and not just slapped on which is a plus), love the cockpit feel though that center console does get knocked for it being poorly in need of better efficiency in its practicality, the crystal gear shift, Android OS is a wash here for me EXCEPT it accepts Apple CarPlay which is a huge pro for me. That said, it gets dinged again for not being wireless, also its not a Tesla so it doesnt come with that baggage

Honestly If the center console area was a bit more function meets form versus form over function (and also yes I understand necessity because of the CMA platform) and there were a few more physical buttons (particularly for the air con which can be a hassle to adjust at times) and it had a physical button to quickly access sports mode. Id think this is basically the perfect car. Oh also if the performance pack came with computer controlled suspension versus manually adjusted. 

Also all that to say a 2022 PPP with sub 10k miles at 31k is a steal and as tempting as all hell",2024-02-09 01:30:17,"Jalopnik: You Can Get Polestar's Tesla Fighter For The Price Of An Accord

"EA chargers dont share capacity like SC do. I did two identical 1800 mile trips and did not see a huge Tesla advantage in charge speeds. I video recorded both trips and took pictures of SoC before and after charging. Let me see if I put the data on google sheets and Ill share it. Did I see higher peak charging rates occasionally, sure.  Overall I didnt see a significant Tesla advantage in charging rates. Teslas advantage is a little better efficiency and more SC location. One SC in particular was brand new(250kw) and in an ideal location for my destination. Do I prefer the Tesla?  Absolutely not!  P2 is a better car in every way that matters (except maybe the whole cup holder situation).  My experience in owning both and putting about 17k miles on each is that the charging rate isnt a distinguishable advantage as anecdotal as that might sound.

"For me, the biggest reason was simply to not give Elon any of my money, little as it may have ended up being.

Beyond that, the quality of materials and overall driving experience mattered a lot. I appreciate that I was actually able to test drive the p*2 multiple times before ordering, even though a family member of mine has a model Y I've sat in.

Lastly, are you sure the sound disparity is as big as you think? I'm not an audiophile, but I do know audio preferences can be personal and the HK system was more than adequate for my tastes.",2023-09-02 16:18:38,"Considering a 2024 Polestar 2 LR DM




I'm considering either the new Model 3 refresh or a 2024 Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor with 19"" wheels, Plus and Pilot packs.

The Tesla has better speakers, more range, more driver and passenger space, and a better app. It's also roughly $15k cheaper.

And yet... I love the look of the P2, even compared to the redesigned Model 3. Help me rationalize spending $15k more for less range, worse speakers, and less space. What am I getting for that?

"-The range disparity probably isn't as dramatic as it seems. Tesla is known to exaggerate and Polestar typically understates. 

-Speakers are probably taste based. With good EQ settings the HK speakers are quite nice.

-Driver and passenger space difference is negligible. Check my last post to see the numbers, but it's virtually identical in actual seating room. That being said, make sure your leg is comfortable with the center console.

-The Model 3 has more trunk space, but not being a liftback is a massive con for being able to use that space.

-The app is better, fair enough

For the extra 15k:

-Substantially improved build quality

-Strong styling 

-If you're a car nerd you'll appreciate the little things. The excellent brakes, the sturdiness of all the steel panels, tactile and tough internal materials.

-Polestar doesn't do ridiculous things that make you embarrassed by them

-Actual physical buttons and stalks 

-The coolest and most practical cluster display that exists 

-Unless it's a Model 3 Performance, the P2 is going to be substantially more powerful",2023-09-02 17:01:23,"Considering a 2024 Polestar 2 LR DM

"I live in Northern NJ, got mine in April 2022 (LRDM with plus and pilot, 19 inch wheels). I actually kept track this winter to see what difference the cold made on my range - I averaged about a 15-20% drop. I have the heat pump. I also do not have a garage so my car is housed and charged outdoors - I imagine a big hit was preheating the car every morning but it's just so nice to get in a toasty car. My typical commute takes about 8% each way but it was closer to 10% during the winter months. I have access to a charger at my house so it really wasn't a big deal. FWIW, it was not a horribly cold or snowy winter here this year but there are lots of Polestar owners in Canada and my reading here found they tended to be happy with their choice. I think the biggest factors are accessibility of charging and how many actual miles you do on a daily basis.",2023-08-29 01:52:11,"True range on Polestar 2 Launch




My wife and I are considering an dual motor Model 3 or a Polestar 2. It will be our first electric car. We live in Vermont on the side of a mountain, so I will try if its necessary. I like the Polestar because it seems to be better built and has more ground clearance. The big challenge for me is the range. At 230 miles it doesnt seem like an awful lot. We live in Vermont and drive quite a few miles. Its also very cold in the winter. If Im losing half of my charge in the winter time that leaves me with even less. What is everyone getting for a true range on their cars?",Reddit
"We have both a Model 3 and a Polestar 2 2023 standard Range. Here's my opinion (probably not overly popular with the Polestar crowd, but I'm trying to remain objective):

Leg room in the back will obviously depend on the height of the people in front - but overall it's not a lot. Our kids tend to complain on longer drives. It's adequate for shorter drives. The Tesla doesn't offer more, though.

We have the single motor FWD: it's a bit of a mixed bag - hills absolutely kill the range, far more than with the Model 3. Probably because of the additional weight of the car. For regular highway driving we get around 400km out of it, though. Overall, it uses a bit more energy than the Model 3 for the same trip.

Pilot pack is worth it, especially for highway driving. Gives you a far more relaxed ride, although it's not ""self driving"", but neither is the Tesla's ""auto pilot"" (at least not here in Europe)

Things it does better than the Model 3:

- Overall aesthetics, it's one sharp looking car. 

- Quality of materials used

- Overall buying experience (Tesla took 10 minutes to explain everything to us, Polestar almost 2 hours)

- The trunk is much more practical 

- Less road noise in the cabin and overall more refined ride quality (but also far less direct power)

- I prefer Google apps and navigation over Tesla's generic versions.



Things it does worse than the Model 3:

- Charging experience. The Tesla can charge much faster (given the infrastructure, obviously) (150kw vs 250kw). Plus the Tesla's charging time calculation is relatively accurate, while the PS2's is all over the place. Neither car can charge at 22kw and defaults to 11kw with lower power chargers, which is annoying.

- Energy use - the Model 3 is more economical overall. Probably due to slightly less weight, more ergonomical design, more efficient electronics etc 

- I prefer driving the Model 3 as it gives you this quite unique impression of space, with a large, almost uninterrupted front view. But some people hate the minimalist cockpit. Plus the Model 3 has too much raw power and a noisier, less dampened ride, giving you a bit of a go-cart feeling. Which I love but my wife hates 

- The Tesla app runs circles around the PS app. It's stable, works 99% of the time to remotely heat the car etc, while the PS app is a complete mess, often won't connect, giving you cryptic error messages ""multiple errors occured"" and won't reliably work to unlock and drive the car (see below)

- Keyless / app-unlocked driving works for the Tesla, while it does not work reliably for the PS2. I'd never use the PS2 without having my physical key along, as we managed to get stuck for 15 minutes at a time because the car wouldn't drive without the key, although the phone was connected to it

- sometimes there are bugs with with the PS2's infotainment and driver system. The driver profile sometimes doesn't identify the current driver and on more than one occasion we weren't able to manually switch the profile, either 

- overall the PS2 is a far more buggy experience than the Model 3. We've had profile issues, sometimes the rear doors won't unlock, the app very frequently doesn't work, the charging estimate is a mess etc etc 

- the Tesla's sentry mode is excellent. But of course, Big Brother is watching you. 

- Tesla gets regular OTA updates, while the PS2 apparently needs to be taken to a service point to get updates installed (we've only had ours for a few weeks, but it's already two versions behind)

Anyway, that's been my experience so far. I'm sure lots of people will disagree or downvote me out of habit as I dared say some good things about the Model 3. Knock yourself out, I'm used to it.",2023-03-06 15:51:31,"Polestar 2 2022 question

If you and your family are taller or bigger than average, then yes the P2 can feel cramped. Leg room and headspace to the roof lining given the hatchback design. 

Real world range is pretty spot on with moderate temperature and driving styles. Any EV will have efficiency declines if those variables change.

"Interesting, so theres not much more leg space difference between the 3 and Polestar. Tesla 3 looks really cool if you look at it outside, but my dad owned one a couple of years back and everything seemed squeaky and cranky.

Now about the cabin noise, its really good you mentioned that, because most of the time, my drives are motorway word and motorway home, and if im driving at 7am, the joise tends to get overwhelming, at least in my Kona. My main idea of changing cars is to squeeze every last bit of range i can from my budget.

In my area they are called Safelite and they use third party parts/glass to do the replacement, which isnt as sturdy as OEM glass.

Polestar has few dealerships (Spaces) in the US. None in Illinois with my nearest being Detroit. Back in 2021 and still in some promotional material they promised they would pickup and return cars for maintenance and repairs if you lived more than a 150 miles from one.

My schedule maintenance light came on, I called customer service who connected me with Detroit, several transfers later someone from maintenance promised to call back, no answer. Several customer service calls later, I finally spoke to someone who promised to set it up including rental car for the period the car was away. All I had to do was call Polestar Roadside assistance to schedule pickup. Roadside Assistance tells me since the car is drive able they do not pickup. Customer service says ""oh yeah, we don't do that anymore"".

Several phone calls to Detroit go to VM. I finally got the manager who set things up initially, he promises to get back to me in 2 hours. That was 2 days ago.

Don't bother with the first maintenance. There's not much of a point in doing it unless your vehicle has actual problems to be resolved. It's pretty much just checking that things aren't wearing out. Wipers, seat belts, cabin air filter, tires.

"The Polestar is going to be 3x as powerful with a dynamic driving focus. It will also be nearly twice as efficient as the Prius Prime (which is the most efficient production non-BEV).

Both have equally practical hatches. Polestar cargo room is slightly smaller but has a much larger max capacity via seat folding (50% larger than when the Prius folds its seats).

I'd be pleasantly surprised if insurance is cheaper. Dual motor P2's are very fast and very uncommon, cranking rates for many.

Your assessment of the dynamics is correct :] The audio doesn't shine until high volumes, but can be overall solid across the range if you play with the equalizer.

Reliability has some pros and cons here:
Pros: 
-Very few moving parts in the drivetrain. As a rule of thumb, EV's are more reliable than ICE, which is more reliable than Hybrid
-Very well put together 

Cons:
-While Volvo/Polestar are generally reliable, Toyota has been at the Prius for 27 years
-In theory the battery could go bad out of warranty; but said warranty is 8 years/100k.


Preconditioning works in one of two ways:

1. While plugged in, preferably in your garage, set a departure time. It will automatically condition.

2. Route to a Charger in the integrated maps. It will condition for fast charging.

The cold will actually reduce battery degradation over the long term as well.

All in all, if you really like driving, there isn't a contest here. You're trading potentially slightly lower reliability for equal practicality and a premium performance car. If you install an L2 in your garage, you'll be fully recharged overnight and be able to precondition every time you leave.",2024-01-12 03:28:53,"Polestar 2 vs Toyota Prius Prime




So Ive been waiting on my order for a Prius Prime since early 2022. Its finally coming at the end of this month. But now used Polestar 2 prices have come way down. Even cheaper than the Prius. It will also be much cheaper on insurance. 

I commute about 160km/100miles per day. I ordered the Prius in order to save gas money. But because I spend so much time in my car, I would like to have some luxury/perks. Not concerned about range, so long as I have enough to get to work and back. 

I test drove a 21 Polestar 2 Performance and I loved it. Smooth. Powerful. Tight steering. stereo was meh but good enough. 
Ive never driven a new Prius yet to compare. 

I love Toyotas and their track record of reliability. So Im just wondering how you guys feel about your Polestar 2s after a couple years of owning? Would you feel confident about owning them for many years? 
Im in Canada and its can get very cold. How well does the pre conditioning work? 

Thanks for any input you all could share!

Edit: Thank you all for your input and feedback. Excellent food for thought. Its true, its not an apples to apples comparison, but it is the same price point. For me it was the things that are unquantifiable, like driving enjoyment, quality etc. that I was wondering if its worth paying for.

"I have a 2022 which I bought last year. I asked the salesperson where the manual was for the car, as I thought it was missing. There was just one small printed booklet with only what appeared to be crucial safety information. As for the car operation, I was told that I could look on the phone app or the center console for the manual. When I tried looking for simple straightforward info, I noticed that the soft copy on the phone and center console did not have either an index or a table of contents, and the search function didn't work very well, with very disjointed results. So I went online to find a PDF of the manual and had it printed and bound professionally. I read all five hundred pages or so front to back and now feel I know enough about the car to operate it. Also I can quickly look up topics in the printed manual. My 2016 Volvo came with a printed manual, so why not Polestar? 
Are printed manuals just not high tech enough to even consider including them with a high tech car?

Firstly, I would say that the P2 specs wise is more equivalent to a model 3 performance which is around 43k with incentives, so the price is slightly closer. I test drove a P2 and really liked it but I would point out a few things. 

Mainly, I think the price is absurd. I really really love the car design wise, but it basically needs the plus and pilot pack to have equivalent features to other 50-60k luxury sport sedans. Yet, after adding those packs it is priced above 55k which is insane. The driving dynamics are a lot better than Tesla in some ways, but the bad range and slow charging on a MORE expensive vehicle really hurts the car's value proposition. The build quality is objectively better than Tesla, but it isn't up to the same level as other luxury cars priced this expensive. I would say its like a slightly better version of a Mazda interior, or a slightly worse version of a Volvo. I'm certainly not complaining about that, its just the price to quality ratio is pretty bad here. For 40-45k I think its a hell of a car. The leather seats cost an additional 4k...

Personally, I am watching the brand with interest because I think they have the BEST designs and some interesting ideas, but I think their pricing is completely absurd. The 3 is also priced higher than a BMW iX and while it looks stunning compared to that ugly monster, specs wise and luxury wise its a wash and BMW wins it hard. I think as the brand matures the service and software experience might get better, and the quality might improve to match the price. I think if they lowered their prices of the 2 and 3 by 10-15k it would be a top choice without debate. Tesla may have bad build quality but it is the most reliable EV brand by a mile. It wasn't always this way, give Polestar time to mature and I think they have potential. Tesla in its first few years had a ton of issues and it has taken almost a decade to get to the point they are at now.",2023-06-01 03:35:42,"Polestar 2 value after no tax incentives

"Yeah my family has owned a Tesla M3 performance for 4 years, never had a single problem but definitely wouldn't purchase one myself due to the lack of premium feel and counter intuitive overuse of tech. One possibility is that starting in 2024 Polestar will manufacture the P3 in the US. They might follow with the rest of the lineup, which could then potentially qualify for incentives and avoid tariffs. The problem is that the CEO stated that Polestar is trying to compete with Porsche, so the pricing model may stay. I don't really buy that the brand can or should compete with Porsche because on both luxury and driving dynamics it isn't in the same league as Porsche. As a consumer I don't think Porsche buyers are remotely interested in Polestar. A bit confused because although I wouldn't compare it with Porsche its still a brand I really \*want\* to buy from but the need to compete in a segment where it hasn't established itself in either product offering or reputation seems strange.

EDIT: On the plus side, my friend owns a Taycan (which is a beast of a car and quite beautiful) and Polestar's infotainment system beats Porsche's easily! Test drive the Polestar, one argument people on this sub use that is certainly true is that the P2 is a fun driving experience. On my limited test drive I thought it was pretty fun too. If you are buying a car for pure utility or value the P2 ain't it, the passenger space is kinda small **but I think the designers purposely focused on the driver experience. That's why you get really good performance in metrics that only car enthusiasts care about such as cornering, braking, handling, etc. and a cockpit-like interior.**",2023-06-01 04:05:57,"Polestar 2 value after no tax incentives

Ive been driving the Polestar 2 so far for about 2,000 miles. This car is not worth its price tag. It feels worse than a Toyota Corolla on the inside After covering a distance of approximately 2,000 miles in the Polestar 2, I have formed some opinions about the vehicle. While I acknowledge its price tag, I must admit that I expected more from this car. Compared to the interior of a Toyota Corolla, the Polestar 2 falls short in terms of comfort and functionality. Surprisingly, despite starting around $50k, the driver's seat lacks full lumbar support, leading to discomfort and back pain during extended drives. The inability to adjust the seat's back position further compounds this issue.

Another aspect that left me disappointed was the design of the cup holders in the center console. They appear poorly executed and do not fulfill their intended purpose effectively. Additionally, the black cloth lining on the console's sides proved to be bothersome as it constantly scraped against my right knee while entering the vehicle, resulting in light marks on the cloth from my scraped skin.

The infotainment system in the Polestar 2 didn't meet my expectations either. It lacks the features one would anticipate in a vehicle of this price range, leaving it somewhat lackluster. I found myself wanting more functionality and convenience from the system.

In terms of driving experience, I must say that the Polestar 2 fell short of my hopes. The safety features, such as lane assist and obstacle avoidance, puzzled me more than they reassured me. On several occasions, the lane assist system unexpectedly attempted to steer me off the road, creating an unsettling experience. Furthermore, during wet road conditions, the car exhibited a tendency to pull away from the lane, assuming I wasn't properly within it. This behavior was not only unexpected but also potentially dangerous.

The obstacle avoidance system proved to be overly cautious, often applying unnecessary braking hundreds of feet before reaching any nearby vehicles. Backing out of parking spots became a jarring experience, as the car would abruptly come to a complete stop, incorrectly perceiving the presence of an object. This unexpected behavior could potentially cause discomfort or even minor injuries.

Considering my overall experience, I cannot confidently recommend the Polestar 2 to others. If I were to draw an analogy, I would compare a Tesla to an iPad Pro and the Polestar to an Amazon Fire Tablet. It's my belief that Polestar should reevaluate their pricing strategy to better align with the features and performance their vehicles offer.


Update: 

Im currently renting this model for about a month. I just understand what the price tag of Polestar 2 can get you in this car market and it makes the Polestar seems lackluster for the price. I would price this car somewhere in the mid 30s to low 40s for what it is.",Reddit
"I mean, all of these criticisms are valid, I just don't think they add up to a trash experience. You're basically saying bumping your knee and having a hard time fitting your cup make it a bad car. To each his own, but that's kinda ignoring the main things about ...cars. It's still a super comfortable, easy driving, glorious suspension, performance ride. Nobody got in the P2 when I rented without saying how fancy or premium it was. Nobody said the seats were uncomfortable. I get that everybody's different, but I suspect your discomforts are more peculiar to some specific needs, and less a function of Polestar pricing the thing wrong.

I would have gotten one for low 40s, but the US cancelled the EV tax credit basically overnight. It's honestly probably for the best for me, since even low 40s is realistically out of my budget, but it felt like such an outstanding deal for the money. It's basically a luxury performance car from an actual luxury performance brand for way less than its competition.",2023-05-25 23:29:45,"The Polestar 2 Sucks

"Heres my Las Vegas, unbiased, heartfelt, 40,000 mile-combined Polestar-Tesla review. I rented one for 4 months through Hertz as I Uber full time. I respectfully think youre smoking Heisenbergs Blue. I had 2,000 miles when I got it and 20,000 miles when I gave it back. I also rented a Red Tesla M3 and a blue one. Im a long legged lanky 61 at 175 lbs.

Worse than a Corolla you say? Like, a Corolla badged Avalon or actual Corolla? Funny enough, Im renting a Model 3 now and I bumped into an Uber driver who drove a Corolla and was complaining that his car is so much better. I called him out on it and forced him to sit in every single seat in the Tesla and go for a ride in it. He apologized for being biased and praised the comfort and space. Now as for the Polestar 2 price, yes its overpriced. That I agree with. Same thing goes for the Polestar 3 SUV

Polestar: 
Pros: Beautiful, dear I say, masculine. It has beautiful exterior looks, DOOR handles with superb one touch open/close, metallic interior DOOR handles, kick open lift gate, HATCHBACK fold flat rear seats (I fit 4 32 off-road wheels and tires), unique one of a kind Thor hammer headlights, factory front/rear fog lights, different option leather seats, cooled seats, interior above-your-head handles, beautiful interior materials (((except the passenger lower B pillar plastic trim piece that would often pop out because people were Neanderthals and kept kicking it trying to get out))) one touch brightness adjusting interior lights, SHIFTER, gauge cluster with optional integrated maps, way quieter interior, more comfortable ride, almost an inch extra clearance, and cool rear trunk grocery bag hooks. I also found the dual range WAY faster than a model 3.

Cons: tech is kind of outdated, range is smaller, charging infrastructure is behind, autopilot is ok, interior space is slightly smaller but slightly more headroom (also hatch), odd rear floor center hump, cup holder is poorly located. The worst experience I had was an over the air update that took out the gauge cluster and 1-2 features. Because it was a rental, Hertz told me to return it so they can ship it to CA for service. It was extremely disappointing but I think Hertz is full of ISHT. These cars are serviced by Volvo. There are a lot of Polestar 2s in Vegas. I DOUBT theyre all sent to CA for a service. Come on now 

Tesla:
Pros: What I said above in P2 cons, slightly more leg and shoulder room, larger screen with more options, more storage space all around, including frunk and rear under trunk, more open space all around and slightly more knee space. I did find the P2 cockpit to fit slightly snug at times. I really liked the red Model 3 looks. I found them very sleek but. Look in cons below.

Cons: Now that I see these cars everywhere Im starting to feel like Im looking at a 2010 Toyota Camry. Theyre still good looking cars (objectively) but they are extremely behind in a FREAKING FACELIFT! Its been almost 7 years since the Model 3 release and not one redesign. Thats pathetic. I see that Tesla is releasing a refreshed Model 3 in 2024 much like Apple is releasing the new iPhone 15. Again, what a joke. A facelift after 7 years is the best you can do? Lets talk about quality. Both Teslas had awful road noise coming from the front DOUBLE PANEL windows. One leaked water inside. The headliner popped out often. Both passengers and driver exterior seat control plastic cover were broken. The interior light buttons are ugly AF and small. The panel gaps. My god the panel gaps. The roof glass pieces are warped. The red Tesla had a huge chunk missing where roof glass meets the windshield. The second has a small chunk missing. That means poor design. The frunk is hard to close. It has to be pushed hard exactly from the center. Both Teslas each caught a nail in the tire. The P2 didnt. The Tesla range is terrible in the summer and cold winter. I lost 100 miles for every 100 miles driven. Thats 100%. Thats terrible. I tried every trick in using the AC to no avail. In the winter I only noticed 10 miles range loss in the P2 for every 200 miles driven. Perhaps its a biased observation. The Tesla door handles suck. I still hate them. The interior is too dark. I complete 100 trips a week and 9/10 people struggle to find the poorly lit escape button. 

So yea. I want a ModelY just because of the range, infrastructure and SUV size space but I know I would spend a lot of $$$ to customize the car. As in body kit enhancements, led rear bar, aftermarket gauge cluster, interior LED lighting, etc. I hear the Model Y is more uncomfortable than a 3 so Im dumbfound. One the other hand I want a P2 performance because I Uber full time but Im a car guy that attends shows, AUTOX and track. The P2 is built for that (albeit its an EV so it will still get hate).",2023-09-19 04:54:27,"The Polestar 2 Sucks

"FWIW if you look through the Tesla pages, there are plenty of people shitting on that car too. 

My seats are supercomfy. Heated, cooled with lumbar.
My knees have adjusted to car. No more rubbing on the cloth.
My cup holder are not great but 80% of the time I only need one. The other times I wish it was designed better.
Best handling and performance car Ive ever owned. I didnt buy a high end Audi, Porsche, or Merc but have driven them. Friends that own similar cars have loved the P2.
Obstacle avoidance is similar on all cars Ive driven. It could be better but could be worse too. If we compared to the Tesla nonexistent auto driving, then every car fall short, including every Tesla.

The price is high, but its a well made car. No janky parts or gaps or misaligned parts. I wish the infotainment did a better job with the real estate available. The software is sus for sure. They need to a better job with that and the app.


Now I will say you lost me at Corolla. Probably everyone dismissed you as a troll when you said that. Also, you got a rental. Almost every rental is bare bones. So Im sorry you didnt have the best experience, but you got what you paid for.",2023-05-26 17:04:49,"The Polestar 2 Sucks

Ive been driving the Polestar 2 so far for about 2,000 miles. This car is not worth its price tag. It feels worse than a Toyota Corolla on the inside After covering a distance of approximately 2,000 miles in the Polestar 2, I have formed some opinions about the vehicle. While I acknowledge its price tag, I must admit that I expected more from this car. Compared to the interior of a Toyota Corolla, the Polestar 2 falls short in terms of comfort and functionality. Surprisingly, despite starting around $50k, the driver's seat lacks full lumbar support, leading to discomfort and back pain during extended drives. The inability to adjust the seat's back position further compounds this issue.

Another aspect that left me disappointed was the design of the cup holders in the center console. They appear poorly executed and do not fulfill their intended purpose effectively. Additionally, the black cloth lining on the console's sides proved to be bothersome as it constantly scraped against my right knee while entering the vehicle, resulting in light marks on the cloth from my scraped skin.

The infotainment system in the Polestar 2 didn't meet my expectations either. It lacks the features one would anticipate in a vehicle of this price range, leaving it somewhat lackluster. I found myself wanting more functionality and convenience from the system.

In terms of driving experience, I must say that the Polestar 2 fell short of my hopes. The safety features, such as lane assist and obstacle avoidance, puzzled me more than they reassured me. On several occasions, the lane assist system unexpectedly attempted to steer me off the road, creating an unsettling experience. Furthermore, during wet road conditions, the car exhibited a tendency to pull away from the lane, assuming I wasn't properly within it. This behavior was not only unexpected but also potentially dangerous.

The obstacle avoidance system proved to be overly cautious, often applying unnecessary braking hundreds of feet before reaching any nearby vehicles. Backing out of parking spots became a jarring experience, as the car would abruptly come to a complete stop, incorrectly perceiving the presence of an object. This unexpected behavior could potentially cause discomfort or even minor injuries.

Considering my overall experience, I cannot confidently recommend the Polestar 2 to others. If I were to draw an analogy, I would compare a Tesla to an iPad Pro and the Polestar to an Amazon Fire Tablet. It's my belief that Polestar should reevaluate their pricing strategy to better align with the features and performance their vehicles offer.

"Compared to the Audi, I would never go for the Golf if the cost for you is the same or similar.

I had an Audi A3 before getting my Polestar 2 (2022 DMLR, Pilot + Plus) - and I often miss my Audi but a lot of it is down to personal preference on driving feel. One note though is that my A3 was a 2018, so an 8V model and not the current 8Y in which the interior is filled up with more plastic. 

Now as for pros and cons between the Audi and Polestar. For me, I prefer lower riding cars, and to me the Polestar 2 feels very tall and the suspension (I don't have the performance package) is a bit more wobbly and it feels less direction stable than my old Audi.   
What I dislike most about the Polestar though is that so many functions are placed on a touch screen, even though Polestar is one of the companies with more physical buttons in an EV. It directs the attention away from the road a lot when needing to make small changes to climate functions - as well as some media controls. Due to the placement of the dial button for play/pause, it's often easier to reach for the touchscreen instead of the button hidden away behind the gear shifter.   
Also hidden behind the gear shifter are the controls for the electric heating of windows and mirrors - and worst of all the hazard lights. I do a lot of motorway driving with heavy traffic, and by law it's mandated to activate hazard lights when traffic is slowing down significantly (often going from 130 km/h to 30-50 km/h during rush hour traffic). 

I have considered going back to an Audi A3 platform, but would probably spend a bit more  unnecessary money and go for an S3 as the acceleration and power of the Polestar far outweighs the A3 petrol offerings in my country. 

When all that is said, the issues I have with my Polestar are very minor overall and in general it's a brilliant car and if I was to pick a similarly priced EV now - my choice would probably be a 2024 Polestar 2 Single Motor Long Range.   
I am waiting to see the pricing of the Audi A6 Etron next year (as well as final design and specs) - otherwise I might wait and see the A4 Etron due in a couple of years. Alternatively see what Alfa Romeo brings out as electric.",2023-10-26 12:07:15,"Deciding between Polestar 2 and VW Golf and Audi A3

"Going on a tangent here:

I very much remember first after I got the car back in 2022 I pulled out a AT&T sim out of the overhead console and Speedtest.net said I was on AT&T.

"I just asked Google Bard AI and this is what it came up with - Im suitably impressed as it explains it all, without going into the fact you can get a Watt Pilot Go that is semi permanently mounted and yet also portable. It sounds like a good thing and it comes from Austria, just down the road from you, but also a country that ran out of letters - lol

Anyway here is what Bard said: No, a Fronius Gen 24 inverter coupled with a Tesla Powerwall and a Tesla charger will not be a smart charger for a non-Tesla EV like a Polestar 2 and only charge when the sun is shining.

The Tesla charger is designed to work with Tesla vehicles and will not communicate with the Fronius inverter or Powerwall to control charging. The Tesla Powerwall can only be used to store energy generated by solar panels, so it cannot be used to charge an EV from excess solar energy.

To charge a non-Tesla EV from excess solar energy, you would need a smart charger that is compatible with the Fronius inverter and Powerwall. There are a few smart chargers on the market that are compatible with these systems, such as the Fronius Wattpilot and the OCPP-compatible EV charger.

These smart chargers can be programmed to only charge the EV when the sun is shining and there is excess solar energy available. They can also be programmed to take into account other factors, such as the time of day, the price of electricity, and the state of charge of the EV battery.

So, if you want to charge your Polestar 2 from excess solar energy, you will need to purchase a smart charger that is compatible with the Fronius inverter and Powerwall.",2023-09-06 14:54:38,"Australian Polestar Drivers

"Yes based on the anecdotal reporting (or lack thereof) as well as my personal experience, the TCAM issues are resolved. Yes it still does need a reset periodically however the software figures this out and does the reset, eliminating the need for a battery disconnect (takes a few mins when it happens, and it can reset itself while driving). And, even when the TCAM needs to be reset, PS figured out how to keep the data services uninterrupted before the car figures out it needs to reset, so GPS is impacted but not data services (big improvement). 

In terms of your other issues, that sounds like non-TCAM related (and maybe specific to your copy of the car). The bluetooth service is not provided by the TCAM (which is in the shark fin antenna on the roof). That's why when a TCAM isn't working, you can still bluetooth tether to the car from your phone and provide data services that way if you'd like (albeit very slow). The key entry is controlled by the same module as BT services I believe (near the center console storage area) so it seems you have some issues with that module. Can't explain the navigation issues. But, if the infotainment reset fixes it, even if only temporarily, it would not be TCAM as TCAM is not reset by rebooting the infotainment. I hope you can get it all sorted!

Performance pack, indicated by gold brake calipers and seat belts.

Plus pack, indicated by sunroof.

Pilot pack, indicated by nose camera, fog lights, or blind spot warnings on the side mirrors.

The vehicle history will likely be 1 owner, fleet car. This and the price are due to Hertz dumping a lot of these into the market.

As long as the software is up to date, you're unlikely to have any real issues with that, and they're built very solidly.

You link your Google account, it's presented as an onboarding step and there is a way to just do it from a phone. It is worth noting that it DOES NOT work with Google Workspace accounts, or whatever they're called. Personal accounts only, and it doesn't seem like this is going to change.

You can create profiles and link them to keys and it'll automatically switch profiles depending on which key it detects (seems a little hit and miss when there are multiple keys, but it's really easy to switch profiles). It will switch when it detects the digital key/phone app and you can link different via profiles IIRC, but I haven't tried, mostly because my wife almost never drives my car. 

The profiles are pretty well sandboxed, they don't share anything between them. You can store mirror and seat position, as well as drive settings (One Pedal Drive settings, steering, creep, etc) and some other stuff aside from different apps and logins.

You should be happy, the Assistant will link into your home stuff and services (aside from controlling a lot of car stuff), you can search for places on your phone and they'll show in the recents in the car, and all your music and stuff will sync.

Linking the Lucid Gravity SUV first look video here for those interested: https://youtu.be/wwSCstfRby8

The specs look pretty promising, real world range of 440 miles on 900 V architecture (not interested in 0-60 MPH times, but for those who are it's 3.5 s). There's the potential of seven seating: stretch based on the video linked above when it comes to comfort but I do love that all the seats apparently go flat making it a great car camping solution during road trips, plus decent trunk space when traveling with dogs. 

Based on published road tests on the Air platform, real world range may be accurate, InsideEV did an article a while back on how efficient they found the Air GT. 

Which brings us to the big question, pricing: base trim will be offered at USD $80,000, though based on pricing the AIR I am guessing a model that would interest me (Touring) would be closer to $104,000 (in the same realm of Polestar 3 Performance), if we use the Air pricing strategy to compare. 

What do you think, fellas? Me thinks Polestar 3 would have to revisit their pricing if Lucid can deliver by 2025 (which I am not too confident they can, but maybe they have resolved their supply chain woes). 

I have no issues with the Polestar 2 (owned not leased), but when I'm thinking of the next vehicle (circa 2027) but the specs for the Lucid Gravity are definitely eye-catching.

"I live in Tampa and like to keep the cabin pretty cool. When driving in the middle of the day at about 95 with the AC off eco, blowing out air that most would consider too cold, and the ventilated seats on, the AC uses about 27-30% of the active consumption, with typically 70-73% going to driving. That sounds like a lot but once you're used to driving it, see the range assistant, remaining miles, etc it's not too much of a concern. 

If you keep it in eco mode under similar circumstances it will go towards about 15% of the battery consumption.

Most of the time I put it in eco in the mornings and evenings when it's not as hot out. In those scenarios typically about 10% of active consumption is from the AC. 

Keep in mind all these numbers are based on the hottest parts of a Florida summer. These numbers are significantly lower in all the other seasons. AC consumption outside of summer is not a concern at all in my opinion.",2023-08-07 17:24:37,"Polestar in warm weather

Basically thieves use an antenna placed near your front door to try and connect to the key and another by your car and relay the messages between the two so as far as both the car and key are concerned, they're talking to each other.

Rolling codes, encryption etc are irrelevant because the key isn't being spoofed, it's being amplified and relayed.

Once the car is unlocked, it's either driven away there and then, or a new key programmed and they're off.

"Bought my LRSM in early August, \~2,800 miles on it so I'm not a long-term tester. I like it a lot, fun to drive, handles well, accelerates nicely once you're rolling (not impressive in the least from a standstill; that doesn't bother me because I don't care about drag racing), and it's very nicely put together. Easy to wash. Corners like it's on rails, very comfortable but firm ride, I use the firm steering setting. Has a sporty feel without the pain of a sports car. Our dog muddies the seats pretty often and they are easy to clean.

A month ago I realized that my driver's-side rear door hasn't been locking. Not cool when parking overnight in Boston, even in a ""nice' neighborhood. That'll be addressed this week (I hope) when I go in for winter tires but it took about a month to get an appointment. I'm just recently getting a dashboard rattle that is infrequent and sounds a lot like the turn signal; happens only on rough roads (most of the roads I encounter, I live in MA where the roads are shit) but it is annoying. I assume it's cold-weather related.

One thing that really blows my mind: it's basically invisible. I have a 2010 Ford Transit Connect that I used for my business; I traded in a 2003 Honda Element for the P2. Both cars attracted much more attention, though mostly at gas stations where I don't take the P2, obviously. I took off the side stickers so there's really no badging except for the logos. People seem to ignore it and I like that. I've seen *maybe* 6 others since I bought mine.",2023-11-28 01:01:11,"Thinking of getting a Polestar! How is the reliability?

"Bought mine used, not CPO, back in April and it's been to the service center once.  On a road trip, the car got an SRS airbag failure light.  We left the car in Seattle, and they replaced a wiring harness under warranty.  Otherwise, no major problems.  Sometimes key doesn't work for a few seconds when I touch the unlock button on the handle, and trunk kick sensor is unreliable for me (probably because of the key thing). 

As for maintenance, the service manual says the only major service is brake fluid replacement every 40k mi.  Everything else is just checks and air filters.",2023-11-28 18:11:39,"Thinking of getting a Polestar! How is the reliability?

"Love my PS2.  


Are you huge?  It's a smallish cockpit (I'm 6'2""). I like it but it's not for everyone.  My overweight dad hates getting in my car.

Are you hauling lots of people?  I don't have kids.  The back seat is small.  And me being tall the seat is almost all the way back and needs to be moved forward to get bigger folks back there.   Not great if you regularly haul people back there. Small kids may not be an issue.


Overall the car drives great.  I have a rattle in the dash that I've tracked to the vent in the speaker grill that the dealer refuses to fix.  If you find a noise like report it right away.  Apparently that warranty is only for the first 10k miles, not the first scheduled service.  NO OTHER ISSUES!!!

The stowaway hitch is amazing and I use it all the time (bike rack).  Get that option!

This tesla debate is beating a dead horse at this point, the question is asking about a used Polestar not polestar vs tesla.

"After 6 months and 15 000 KM of ownership, here are some tips:

* There is a curry hook hidden in the glove compartment. Handy for takeaway food or for hanging a small bag/purse.
* There are pen holders in both centre console pockets.
* If you are in EU - Ionity and Polestar are collaborating to give cheaper fast charging (IIRC 30-40 cents per kWh).
* You can join or split the climate control temperature by clicking the temperature number on the screen.
* You can [enable the parking lights via the light switch](https://www.polestar.com/us/manual/polestar-2/2021/article/Parking-lights). This will turn on the front and rear parking lights (the license plate lighting will also illuminate). These lights will stay on when the car is parked. Handy for parking on dark roads.
* A long press on unlock button of the big clunky key (that no one uses) will open all the car windows.
* **Pre-conditioning the battery is only possible by setting a timer.** The pre-conditioning button on the app will only cool down/heat up the cabin - Pretty annoying if you ask me.
* If the car comes to a stop and the driver gets out of the car, it will automatically enable the Park mode. In theory, this means you never need to press the P button, although I press it every time just to be sure.
* The projected in the gauge cluster is based off the WLTP of the car (this is the Standard setting). Since P2.9 you can change the projected range from Standard to Dynamic, which projects a range based on your previous driving.
* If you are using Adaptive Cruise Control (included in the Pilot pack) and you are matching the speed of the car in front of you, using the blinker to overtake the car in front of you will speed up the car. You do not need to press the gas pedal to overtake the car in front.
* If the software is ever acting up (which can happen from time to time), you can press the home button on your screen for 20 seconds to restart the software. You can also do this **while driving.**
* Press and hold the windscreen heater button for 30 seconds to hard reset the system. Polestar does not recommend you do this.
* If the car does not recognize the wireless keys the car won't drive. However, you can still drive the car by putting the keys in the cupholder under the armrest.
* If you live in a rural area, I recommend installing an anti-marten system. This is recommended for all EVs. These little creatures love to make nests out of battery isolation material.
* Make sure to always download the OTA updates. Polestar has a certain timeframe of a few weeks where you can download it. If this window closes you are stuck on the version you have and need to visit a shop to get the upgrade.
* Sadly, Polestar does not have a feature like Tesla's Century Mode. I installed a dashcam myself to mimic this feature. They come in all various models and sizes. A lot of Polestar users have the [FitcamX](https://fitcamx.com/products/fitcamx-dash-cam-for-volvo) because of the OEM look.
* Don't overthink it, just do it

These are just my experiences and I hope this helps, enjoy!

"And honestly the entire value proposition blows up if you have cheap gas.

Sure when it's $6.00 a gallon in California an EV makes sense. But I filled up my Sportage here in Minnesota today for $2.30 a gallon.

Gas here is cheaper than public charging is. And my local power company charges as much for home charging as it does for their public chargers that they installed at the local strip mall.

I was considering buying a PHEV before I bought my Sportage. But I quickly realized that the PHEV would never pay for the difference within 10 years.

My workplace has chargers but they aren't free and cost more than premium Gasoline does here on average. 

The only way it would work would be if I installed a Solar Array at home and on site storage and had it completely separate from my grid. Because of local ordinances you actually don't ""Own"" any of the power you generate. If I installed solar panels I legally would be required to sell all the power they generate back to the power company at their ""Fair market value"" Rate. Then buy said power back from them at the price they charge me.

And doing the above would be so expensive that it would defeat the purpose of buying a PHEV. Which is why I'm probably never buying a PHEV or BEV until things seriously change on a local level here.

God I fucking hate my local power company. But Utility Monopoly's are a thing and are fully legal. (And are encouraged) So I'm just kind of fucked.",2024-01-30 00:03:33,"Polestar To Cut 15% Of Its Staff Globally Amid Challenging Market Conditions

"Small correction. Its Honda that ripped off the tail lights. Volvo has been using long vertical tail lights since the 80s and the 850. Its a staple of the brand, kinda like kidney grilles in BMWs, so calling it a ripoff is grossly incorrect. Its a design element that lots of companies have copied one time or another.

The XC40 which is the car youre talking about is not the best example of a modern Volvo, its basically the cheapest entry point to the brand. Id recommend trying the larger SPA platform cars like the S90/XC90, their interiors are orders of magnitude nicer.

As for its positioning in the market, its at the same point as Lexus. Both make great cars, but sometimes struggle to be perceived as as premium as the older luxury competitors.

And Polestar, it honestly shouldnt exist in the form it does now. It was a racing team bought by Volvo with the intention of branding their performance offerings, it was that for about 15 minutes, and then they spun it off into a separate all electric brand.

"The screen on my wife's car was kind of weird at first, but my wife and I have gotten so used to it that we never feel the need to switch it into regular mirror mode. The lights at night do get blown out a tad, but not enough to make it useless. I can still tell if lights behind me are approaching fast or slow, which is pretty much all I need to know. Once the car is within a certain distance, it's clear enough to identify the shape of the headlight. The camera adjusts exposure to accommodate for night time, unlike the backup camera on my car (over a decade old) that basically is useless at night. During the day, the brightness over a standard mirror makes it a really good experience.

The only things I don't like are that the shutter speed makes some LEDs look like they're flashing, and the field of view is slightly narrower than a mirror, making cars sitting behind you look like they're in your back seat. But you get used to that part quickly, much like you get used to your own car seeming like it's closer or further away from the car in front depending on ride height and hood length.

"completely honestly and unironically, the reported issues with CARIAD and the brief issues I had with software in the Taycan on a test drive make me wary of getting a VAG product and would be a reason I'd pick a Volvo or Polestar over a Porsche.

For a roadster that's primarily for driving on the twisties might not matter as much. But for a 4-5 seater GT like the Taycan or P5, I care more about how the software overall works.

MB: deeply focused on bling over substance, the EVs are basically a sales flop due to lacking any real form of differentiation from other EVs. MB is probably the best of the three German though, they are doing the MB thing. 

BMW: focused on edgy over beautiful, these designs will probably not age well. Nickel and dime in tech space subscriptions is in full thermal runaway. Working hard to destroy their legendary Ultimate driving machine tagline with simply compromised  designs. 

Audi: worst situation of the three. They just dont make anything notable anymore. Excessively edgy racing inspired interiors lack comfort and the tech situation is a trainwreck. Their best car is just a rebadged Taycan for Taycan money.

On the positive side it feels very spacious, has great visibility and is almost Apple-like in how it feels familiar to use after only a minute or so.

The Polestar feels tighter and like a better put together product. It feels more like car than a thing, compared to the Model 3.

"Thats. thats how most cars are, lol. I own a Ford era Volvo assembled in Gothenburg and has FoMoCo parts that are stamped made in Belgium. The control arms we replaced in my fathers 2014 Ford F-150 had the FoMoCo stamp and made in China.

The reason why where it was assembled matters is thats where the fit and finish of a car happens. Its pretty hard to mess up casting a solid metal suspension part. It is easy however to mess up torque specs and create slop in said suspension, steering, interior trim, etc. Assemblies in Europe, United States, and Canada have historically been better at staying to spec compared to factories in Mexico and China.",2023-04-06 16:10:50,"Polestar 2 Beats Tesla Model 3 To Become The Most Popular Electric Company Car In Germany

That is pretty much by design too, because two door vehicles these days are mostly relegated to second or third cars.  Most average income people aren't going to buy a two door, and given that EVs are a small portion of the market for now, that means the R&D isn't worth it.

This is especially considering that most EV platforms rely on having a battery ""skateboard"" with all of packs under the floor.  This means that the roof line has to be higher, which is a problem for sports cars because they need to be low.

Cadillac CTS-V, BMW M5, Lancis Delta Integrale, Charger Hellcat... all of them have 4 doors or had a 4 door variant, and all of them are a blast to drive in one way or another.

The primary reason so many who enjoy driving also dislike EVs or are at least hesitant to switch is because an electric drivetrain, no matter how powerful, will never have the engagement, quirks, or personality of a well-sorted internal combustion engine drivetrain. You can't manually change gears in an EV because there's no manual equipped EVs out there, you can't feel boost build up in an EV, you don't get to hear the revs climb nor induction noise unless it's artificially generated by speakers (and those systems simply can't stack up to the real thing), you don't feel nearly as connected with the car or as much like you're in control of the experience.

"> Sports cars have almost always been an engine that came with a free car

That's a muscle car.

Sports cars aren't defined by engines, they're defined by seating position, road manners, carving tight turns in a spirited drive, carrying a minimum of unnecessary stuff.

The engine of a Miata isn't the core experience, it's the small body, sitting low to the ground, taking up barely half a lane.

To that end, a thick skateboard chassis'd EV will fail to really capture what it is to be a sports car because it'll force the driver too high up above the roll centre, (even though the low CoG reduces body roll)

A good sportscar EV will have to package the batteries differently from the generic SUV/sedan, at least with current and immediate future technology.",2023-09-07 20:27:37,"Isn't a bit grim that we don't have that many 2 door evs ?

Out of the 5 cars I have owned in my life have 3 been 3 door cars (two door but hatch back style) and the 3 and 2 door body styles are just so much better looking than 4 or 5 door cars in my opinion and I can't say that having two fewer doors make much of a difference from a practicality standpoint. The two or three times per year I have someone in the back seat doesn't make enough of a difference to consider having a 5 door over a 3 door and I still have as good of a boot to put my stuff in as a 5 door car.

But a 2 and 3 door body style have one big positive over a 4 and 5 door that makes it sportier. Fewer openings means stiffer for the same weight Wich means better handling.

"I said almost always because I accounted for cars like the Miata. However, all of those factors you mentioned are still engineered and designed around one core component, the heaviest and largest part of the car; the engine. Sports car design is always a huge compromise, pushing the bleeding edge of design and materials to give the driver an engaging driving experience while lugging around a 500lb+ block of metal and all of its components. To make the compromise worth it, manufacturers crank up the characteristics of the motor. If youre gunna lug around a 500lb brick of aluminum, at least itll rev to 9500rpm and make tons of power.

In a world of EV sports cars, there will be virtually zero need to engineer a perfect weight distribution, as a properly placed battery pack and motors will almost guarantee it, and itll likely sit in the center of the wheelbase. There will be no competition between front engine or mid engine, there will be no competition between high revving horsepower or low end torque, there will be no comparison between how a car is geared and whether its better at acceleration or top speed.

A manufacturer can spend billions engineering the most aerodynamic shape and the most planted suspension geometry and make the car as light as possible, but in the end, a competing manufacturer can do the same thing and theyll likely end up using the exact same motor and battery components, and those components will likely be the same ones used in their $30,000 economy car, just arbitrarily cranked up to max output.

One of the largest aspects of choosing a sports car; the engine and drivetrain - will be completely gone in the near future. Youll pick your shape, and *maybe* an option of a cheap low output motor or the expensive high output motor. Thats it. Itll be the same for every single sports car that gets electrified.",2023-09-07 20:58:58,"Isn't a bit grim that we don't have that many 2 door evs ?

"Second to last paragraph is where I mentioned suspension geometry.

Second paragraph is where I touched on battery placement. With less mechanical components than an ICE car, there are more places to put the battery within the wheelbase/track. The batteries can be split front and back to allow the driver to sit at the lowest possible point of the chassis. Running in parallel voltage, the bank can be separated as many times as needed in order to fit where it has to. Its really no different than fitting a fuel tank somewhere on a high performance car. At least battery banks can be made much thinner/flatter than fuel tanks, allowing for the bank to sit under the driver and still not affect driving position, as the height different will be negligible.

We honestly see this trend manifesting within the crossover SUV market. With most 4 cylinders on the market being nearly identical in terms of performance and reliability, and all these SUVs being designed to maximize space and size efficiency for passengers and cargo, what really is the difference between them that people look for? Everything has CarPlay, entry models mostly have heated seats and sunroofs, so what is it that consumers look for anymore, if everything being offered is so substantially similar?

"My point is, while ICE cars get billions dumped into them to develop technology and trickery like that using moving mechanical parts and materials, EVs can easily achieve those things sometimes with a push of a button or simple software programming, significantly reducing the R&D overhead.

Eventually, much like the CUV market, the EV sports car market is gunna reach the pinnacle of efficiency when it comes to center of gravity, weight distribution, ride height, inertia, wheelbase, track width, etc and maximize performance (almost like how the ICE sports car market has now), and theyre all gunna be doing so using the same motors and the same batteries and the same torque distribution algorithms, unlike ICE cars still differentiating themselves with their powertrain options.

Lets face it. Weve already reached the pinnacle of chassis and suspension and aerodynamic engineering with the materials we have available to us today. The last saving grace we look for in a cool car nowadays is the powertrain. High revving? Low end torque? Perfectly balanced? Naturally aspirated? Turbocharged? Dual clutch? Gated manual? You get a wide variety of choices that really make a car standout from the next carbon monocoque chassis mid engine go cart with active aero. With EVs all using the same motors that arent restricted by size, weight or taking up space like an ICE is, you lose that one last piece of variety that buyers look for.

"I'm trolling? You just called a to scale picture ""misleading"". I'm a 6 ft tall dude and while I can plug-in with one hand, I've had to use two hands to plug in my ID.4 at EA chargers before to make sure it gets seated properly. This is doubly true in the winter when the cables are very inflexible. Do you drive your CCS EV at all?

"I dont think thats relevant to this discussion at all.  Im not advocating for it, but someone that is going to use the screen to change things while driving would likely pick up their phone instead if they didnt have the option.  At least the screen is more central to the road and there are steering wheel and voice controls.  So I would argue that in those cases where a person is going to do it anyways, doing it via CarPlay is safer.  

If you understand people use things differently I dont understand why its so hard to comprehend a given feature being a dealbreaker or not.  If someone were to say GM lost my business when they stopped offering heated seats you wouldnt be like I live in Florida, who needs heated seats?

"If you havent used it, you dont know what youre missing. Siri can reply to people (even automatically if you set a driving response), you can use whatever navigation software and music apps you want. Youre not limited to one just because an automaker struck a deal with one app. 

Also, manufacturers leaving the software design to Apple and Google was the best big change to hit interiors IMO. Your car touchscreen is just a screen; your phone runs the software. This means the apps are updated forever and the speed stays fast since youll get a new phone every 2-4 years.

"I'm 30 and the current list of cars owned so far is:

2006 Skoda Fabia - my first car and a proper shitbox given how modern it was at the time. No central locking or electric windows so my dad was chuffed there was nothing to go wrong. The mighty 1.2 made about 50bhp and got to 60 in over 18 seconds. It's still the car I've had for the longest, and I miss that gutless little thing.

2006 Honda Civic - ultra-reliable, good on fuel, alright to drive. Bored the hell out of me. Standard Civic stuff.

1993 Subaru SVX - always lusted after one after I saw a red one coming out of school one day, had no idea what it was so booted up Gran Turismo 2 to find out. Took a trip up to Yorkshire and happened to find a nice red one up for sale for not very much money, and on looking through the logbook saw it was sold just outside the original village I grew up in. Given there's fewer that 300 in the UK, it had to be the one I saw as a kid, so fate said I had to have it.

2000 Porsche Boxster S - another car I stumbled across that was up for not much money, and my first proper sports car. Loved the sound of the flat six and the handling, and still miss it. Had a very odd jade green interior but I think that helped it stand out. Sadly couldn't justify spending almost what I paid for it to put in a new clutch etc. at the time so it had to go.

2015 Mazda MX-5 - this was during the time when finance rates were dirt cheap, so went for the sports car feel of the Boxster with the reliability of the Civic. This thing was great to hoon around in, but I'd always missed the power of the Porsche.

2018 SEAT Leon Cupra 300 - decided to be more sensible and get a hatchback for lugging things around. It had plenty of grunt but not much in the way of character, though the extra refinement was a nice change. Kept it for just over a year before somebody ended up stealing it off my driveway. Imagine it's in lots of bits now.

2010 Porsche Boxster - I was now car-less and in need of something that wouldn't be stolen and wouldn't cripple me on insurance now that I'd had to register a claim, so the hot hatches were out. Looking around, somehow a Boxster was 100 cheaper to insure than a Kia C'eed ecobox, so it seemed like a no brainer. This one also came with a 3 year warranty, so it's sticking around until that runs out 

1975 Porsche 911 - First foray into classic car ownership, absolutely wonderful to drive when I'm not terrified that something will go wrong. So far, the only thing to break was the wing mirror fell out after I'd parked up and started walking away...",2024-01-14 20:48:56,"How many cars have you owned and how old are you?

\- VVW Golf -97, 1.6 GL

Dad's old car, gave it to us kids as a shared car, really high-mileage car at over 530k km until it got scrapped due to body being eaten away by rust, but mechanically - such a trooper, always started and just... Ran. Really reliable car, grew up with this being in the family. It will always be a very special car to me, dad also still misses this one! No ABS, no A/C. Original engine, never opened. The clutch was slipping quite heavily before it was sent to the crusher, though. RIP.

\- VW Vento -94, 1.8 CL

My first own car, first year of university life, constantly broken one way or another. Sigh. Of course, I had a sub installed in the trunk. Came with BBS wheels that everyone kept trying to buy from me. It was sold in 15 mins once the listing was updated to read ""BBS WHEELS"" in the title. :D Ha. I sold it, because it wasn't financially reasonable to keep driving it. Had a cracked block, blown head casket. Oh yeah, also like 15 owners before me. After this, carless for about a year.

\- Citron C5, 2.0 automatic

Can't remember the year - it was a loaner car from my then-wife's dad, drove it for 6 months, 2.0 automatic, first gen C5, station wagon. Had the funky hydraulic suspension. While driving this one back to its owner, the hydraulic pump(?) died. The car lost power steering and suspension... On a 5-hour drive, at -30c. :D At least heating worked fine. Was carless again, for about 2 years.

\- koda Felicia -00, 1.3

Got it for free from a relative after they lost their license at 85 years old, it had only 45k km on it after 13-or-so years! Couldn't get fuel consumption to go under 10 liters per 100 km/h, no matter what. In return, it was extremely fast to heat up at -30c, being the warmest winter car I've experienced, ever. Driving it was like being tortured, though! Also, so slow that overtaking often wasn't a realistic possibility.

\- Audi A3 -97, 1.6

Base model, but had a working A/C. Had it for around 2 years, the worst headlights ever put in a road-legal car! High mileage car at 330k km on it, when I bought it. Had it lowered, it was a horrible decision. Traded it in for the A4 below.

\- Audi A4 -05, 3.2 V6 Avant, manual

The first car I ever financed. Drove it for about 6 months until trading it in for the Passat below. My first car ever to break down on me while driving. Broke down in front of a mechanic's shop, at least... The first ""performance"" car I've had, also my first ever AWD car. Had about 175k km on it when I bought it.

\- VW Passat CC -09, 3.6 VR6

My current car, also BY FAR the most reliable car I've had. The fastest and the newest, too. Overall, pretty damn good car. Makes the best sound too, VR6 is the ultimate cheat code for that. I adore this engine, absolutely love it. Have owned it for about 2.5 years now. About 261k on it now, bought it at 237k km. Excited Wookie sounds!",2024-01-14 21:35:54,"How many cars have you owned and how old are you?

"1-Chevy chevrette, don't remember year
Hand me down
1.5-69 VW bug.  Tried to completely rebuild but for my tool and knowledge bank at the time was more than I was capable of. About 1/2 way through I broke the windshield and sold it all. Never drive it
2-Toyota Celica, 1975. We were racing Toyota's at the time and I built a top end strong 20 r for it that would blister the iroc z of the time and if it was a factory automatic, the 5.0 mistan
3-Plymouth trail duster, don't recall the year. Drove it a month and dropped a rod cap from the heybo rebuild that was done before I got it  sold it
4-92 Isuzu truck, slammed to the ground. Purchased new   ground effects molded, c notched frame, lots of music, snug top, and diamond tilt everything. Won under construction in boogar bash in 1994 I think it was. Totaled by a drunk woman.
5-94isuzu truck 2wd, flipped ball joints, cranked bars, 3"" blocks in the back , 3"" body lift, 32x10.50 swampers with a locker, tore it up and traded with 65k on the clock
6-F150, last year of the boxy body style, work truck package, drove it a few years and it needed a lot of frint end work. Was scared of the twin I beam front end because I was still pretty young and inexperienced so traded it on a...7-99chevy 1500 with the work truck package. Drove it about 18 months and my son was born. Couldn't see to back a boat with a car seat between the wife and I. Traded it on a 
8-2004 F150 with the back seat. Drove it 2 years. Hated the cloth seats that would stain from water and the rear end started to slip. While looking for a fix for that both power windows broke and the radio went out. Traded it and the wife's Alero for a 06 torrent for her. I don't count that as mine.
9Full size dodge, 04 I think. Needed a front end but paid 4k cash and I got a full kit for maybe 250 bucks and put 8t in myself. I hated that truck  brown and gold... And dodge. Totaled by a kid pulling out and almost hit me head on. Both kids in the truck with me. Destroyed my front end.
10-Jeep, TJ. That right  the year they didn't sell them because they sold to Daimler I believe it was. Still got it. Had to learn to weld to keep it on the road. Currently down as the subframe beneath the roll bar attachment points was rotting. Kinda hit the back burner. Couldn't pull my boat so I also got another 
11-96 F150 lariat with the 2 door extra cab and a camper shell. Strong truck, fixed everything that was currently broke from a half price holiday at the pick your part yard. Truck was from Florida, I got it for a song and it pulled the boat great.  Started chasing electric issues due to rust and corrosion. Got sick of it and sold it for more than I had in it. Inherited my current truck, 
12- 06 GMC Sierra, 2wd. With a factory locker. 5 in lift in the front, 3in the back sits level., on my 2nd set of tires which are 33 I believe. Had to swap rear ends at 60k because it spit the pinion bearings out and then started eating them.. it had sat a while so when I got it with about 30k on it, all new brakes, rubber, and such when I lifted it. Went with a slightly different ratio on replacement rear end so it keeps a braking or speed alarm. Wheel sensors and speedo don't jive. Sitting at about 130k and running strong. About time for brakes, hoses , belts and all again. 

So 12, I have had 12 vehicles, I just turned 50.but a young 50",2024-01-14 21:47:34,"How many cars have you owned and how old are you?

"I'm 24 and I'm on my 36th cars. Owned mostly beaters but a few of my favorites in order of most favorite is
1: 2000 Ford Escort zx2. This car was such a shitbox it was awesome. I beat the absolute piss out of it and it never let me down.
2: 1988 Merkur XR4TI (still own) I grew up playing rally games and the Sierra Cosworth has been one of my favorite cars since I was a kid. Saw my car for sale and did a little bit of research and WOAH. Same car as the Sierra but under a different name. Ford took what they learned from racing the XR4TI when developing the Sierra Cosworth. 
3: 2017 Camaro RS (still own) This is one I wasn't necessarily expecting to ever buy as a kid. I always thought ew american cars can't turn and BOY was I wrong. I test drove quite a few cars before I drove the Camaro and WOW. It's on another level from anything else I test drove.
4: 2006 Chevy Cobalt SS. This was one of the first cars I owned that actually had some power to it. Was suuuuper fun hearing the supercharger whine and being pushed back into my seat. Before this I mostly owned Honda's and mini trucks.
5: 1988 Mazda B2200. It was my first car. I dropped it 4"", and threw a bitchin sound system in it. My mom made me sell it though as I got caught drifting a roundabout by some ones security camera ",2024-01-14 22:15:51,"How many cars have you owned and how old are you?

"20 Ive owned 3 cars:

1. 08 Grand Prix Base (scrapped)

Hand me down from my grandma, she somehow got the odometer rolled back 150k (numbers didnt match up whatsoever on the ownership history) and she only took it to a mechanic that replaces bad parts with used parts because it might overdo the other worn components because its too powerful. Could stick your hand in through the wheel well to the seat and car would randomly shut off when we were driving. So thankful I got it as a first car but it was fucking scary

2. 01 Honda Prelude Base (still own)

My baby, 283k on the shell, 150k estimated on the H22A4, 215k on the M2S4 4th Gen transmission. 
Manual swapped it, threw in a XTD lightweight flywheel, exedy clutch kit, exedy master/slave cylinder, didnt cut any corners in the swap. Redid the whole suspension (coils, sway links, control arms, tie rods), redid some engine seals, did some mods. Now its sitting in storage while it awaits some body panels to arrive so it can be free of rusty quarters and sills. Still lots of maintenance that Id like to tackle (not all are necessary but trying my best with this resto-mod almost and some fun stuff)

3. 97 Honda Accord SE (still own)

Got this as the daily for the daily but needed tons of work suspension/steering wise because it sat in a garage for so long, but I dont mind because it gives me something to do. I ripped it apart from September-October and redid everything suspension/steering wise, new exhaust, new cat, new headlights, engine/ignition maintenance, paint matched the OEM lip kit, mugen rep grille, Authentic JDM SiR lip I have yet to paint, beefier tires/rims, tons of little JDM Accord pieces, and little things here and there such as a K&N intake, neuspeed strut bar, progress and Addco lower front and rear sway bars. 

Still lots planned for both cars but as any car guy I made the daily too clean to winter drive, than I made the daily for the daily too clean. So now I need to save up for a dedicated daily",2024-01-14 22:16:57,"How many cars have you owned and how old are you?

2018 Camaro 2LT aka Blue. First big boy purchase. Only got a v6 bc the car payment was enough, the insurance for an 18 yr old guy was out the roof for a v8. Lasted me 6 years and went on 3 cross country road trips with it. Survived living in Seattle too.

"Owned is a difficult word for me

Currently my used car dealership is just hitting 10k of cars in inventory.

However, this is only vehicles that we stock then as well. Son that I've used purely for wholesale or for parts or not counted.

A few of my personal vehicles also weren't counted.
Personal vehicles are also difficult to decide as some were stocked and some were not.

My best guess is 50-60 cars as personals while I'm 30 years old.

I currently have 4 personal cars right now for reference.

Currently I have:
1. 2007 Honda S2000 Track/AutoX prepped

After the first two Fords, where one replaced the other, the Focus I owned with the 06 F-150, then sold both for the 2019 MINI, and the 98 and 02 Rangers (solid little off-roaders), before the Pandemic changed everything. MINI went, Ford Fiesta came along (discounted and cheap), and then the 18 F-150 after everything started opening up again. Sold the Fiesta for the 11 MINI, which was a super cheap car to buy in 2021, and then after gas prices shot up, along with everything else, I traded the 18 F-150 for the 22 Ranger (better gas mileage and better for my needs overall).

Bought the Taco for a project and runabout. Probably going to sell it after I fix the ignition issue.

1. 98 Volvo S70 in high school.  I had money aside and my parents said I could have input. Then they showed up with that thing. It was a tank and pretty comfy but I saw just about every warning light on that car

2. 06 Suzuki Forenza - Owned for a day. Got it from my mechanic as this lady had to leave the country. Stupid cheap.  Flipped and made an extra $2k

3. 94 Honda Del Sol. 106 HP, 5 speed, no power steering. Wanted to learn more about cars and tastefully modify it.

4. 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer Evo X.  Flexed my financial aid grant money + college job + untaxed tips to fund this. I think of it like the ex that got away.  I poured money into payments and insurance. Never got around to modifying it how I wanted. Still wonder when Ill get it back or if it will give me the same feeling.

5. 2015 Acura ILX - 6 speed, my Civic SI in a suit Evo was approaching high miles and I didnt wanna pour more money into it. This was my..adult ish out of college car.

6. 90 Mazda RX-7 - weekend car/project car split with a good friend. Eventually got bought out of it.  Car was so much work and for the little amount of driving I could do on it, it didnt make sense to go 50/50 on expenses.

7. 2015 Chevy Volt - Commuting for work, PHEV privileges + work reimbursement meant that using this car for work made me money.  Awesome car, wouldve loved it for a daily..but the state of the car market with Covid meant I wouldnt probably have gotten a good deal on my current car.

8. 2020 VW GTI - in my head paid homage to my favorite features of cars.  A somewhat nice interior of leather and all modern amenities.  A functional hatch for my 2 kids. A 6-speed thats tuned to 300HP, lowered, and still reliable at 30k miles that will pull 30MPGs easily.  Best deal yet, negotiated 7k off MSRP, and a stupid low interest rate that I think its worth what I paid for it now still.",2024-01-15 04:45:44,"How many cars have you owned and how old are you?

Learned on a manual tacoma that was my dad

1) Dakota. Unknown year. Bought it off Craigslist for 500. Worked great for a few weeks. Then it didn't. 

2) 1999 mazda protege. Bought it for 800 as it had no ac,no radio,windows minus the passenger side didn't roll down,trunk didn't open and had a few mechanical issues.  I got it around 200k and sold it around 300k. Fixed it to where everything worked and it never failed me minus the alternator going bad. Great car. 

3) 2014 mazda 6 manual. Bought in 2017 for only 18k,0 down and 3%. Felt luxurious especially for the price. I miss it sometimes. Sold in 2021

4) my current car. Bought it in 2019. 2013 mazdaspeed 3. Always wanted one since 2009. Sitting at 400hp,made to daily yet autocross. Dreams do work out,she's been amazing.

5) 2021 tacoma sr utility. Bought sort of brand new from enterprise for only 20k with around 20k on it. Apparently owned by a hvac company who decided to upgrade to frontiers and rams for some reason. She never failed me,came with zero issues minus some scratches. Got her as a second car for my wife and I as we don't plan on having children for a few more years. Unfortunately I was t boned by a bmw running a red light sending me rolling a few times ending up ass backwards in a ditch so RIP. I'll miss her. Kept me safe as only superficial wounds



There's a 6th sort of. My previous company gifted me a 2018 f150 lariat. Our company grew massively and our old trucks weren't capable of hauling anything we had now. It was a fab shop that did a lot of construction work with an on site team as we did specialty work for installing and a shop crew. I ran a shop shift of around 20 people responsible for millions. At times I'd have to go to field or across states, sometime out. I made a joke how our shop gm got a truck allowance which  was used on a dodge rebel sothe other manager and I should get one. I didn't think they'd take it serious so just said a ford. I got a f150 lariat and he got a Silverado 1500 something fancy. It was essentially ours. We drove it to work and personal things as you would normally do,no company logo. Just ours on the condition if we leave then we either pay a fee to keep it or return. We only paid insurance. When I left ,it was around 10k to buy. I was dumb and declined out of anger...Im an idiot and will always miss that truck. It's the second best vehicle I've ""owned"" and the most comfortable ive been in. It was the 3.5 too",2024-01-15 05:58:03,"How many cars have you owned and how old are you?

"Im in my late 30s, consider myself a car, track day, and sim racing enthusiast. Before I was any of those things I owned:

* 1989 Volkwagen Polo 1.3 (broke two days before the driving test I was set to take in it)
* 1992 Volkswagen Polo 1.3 (rare early multi-point injection model, different to the GT engine)

Then I got into LiveForSpeed and sim-racing and bought:

* 1991 Volkswagen Polo G40 with AquaMist water-injection, Eaton M45 supercharger, a water-air intercooler, cera-metallic paddle clutch, lightened flywheel, balanced knife-edged crank, G40 Cup Car LSD with massive preload, running around 200BHP from 1.3L
* 1992 Volkswagen Polo 1.3 as a run-around while the G40 was having work done that came with free hidden weed (I didnt realise until after I got free work done, couldnt understand why, but the car stopped smelling like weed afterwards). I lost the keys so opened the door and started it with a pair of scissors jammed into the locks. It got stolen and written off, and Id love to have seen the criminals explaining that the car already had broken locks and a destroyed ignition barrel!
* 1989 Volkswagen Polo 1.3 Coupe to replace the stolen run-around, super low mileage, mint condition

Then I got really into sim racing and wanted something reasonably light, rear-drive, turbo, with double-wishbone suspension all round, and good weight distribution, that was famous for good handling, so back in 2008 the last car I have bought to date:

* 1996 fn RX-7 Type RS, low-mileage imported from Japan, with 99 spec front bumper and rear wing, on Mazdasport MS-01 wheels, street ported and mapped to around 320BHP, wearing Yokohama Advan AD08R",2024-01-15 08:29:32,"How many cars have you owned and how old are you?

But since i was a used- car Dealer and Car Breaker for 8 years, i might have technically ""owned"" several hundred cars and probably still do, assuming i could probably build one or two entire cars from the leftovers in my garage.

"Im 21, currently on my 2nd car

1st car was 01 Mini Cooper, endless problems which drained me mentally, bought by my parents 1200 in 2020, learned to drive manual in this car before getting a license, father did not want to sell it to buy me a Toyota instead of the Mini, said he wanted to drive it, gave me his car instead 
(Drove it from Septemeber 2021- February 2023)

2nd car- 07 Skoda Octavia- were the first owners, doesnt have a lot of mileage (got it at 81k km, currently at 87k km) so far its reliable, only had to replace HVAC temp sensor which was cheap and to remove the alarm horn, apart from that solid. (February 2023- present time)

Cars I want to buy:  currently I am a university student, after I graduate a car wont be my first priority but eventually I want to buy either a top spec Aygo or Yaris hybrid as my own first bought car, and eventually buy a red Corolla or Camry with light interior (if I am well off Im skipping the Aygo/Yaris and going directly for the Corolla/Camry) and if I am really well paid apart from the daily sedan I will buy a GR YARIS manual",2024-01-15 11:16:16,"How many cars have you owned and how old are you?

 - **2011 Infiniti G37xS**. First car I ever bought and I treated it like gold. Detailed it personally at least once per month. It had almost 140k miles on the clock when it was hit and totaled by an elderly driver in an old Kia in 2018. The tow truck driver and cops thought it was brand new.

 - **2012 Infiniti G37xS**. I tried to fill the void that losing my 2011 left with the exact same car, down to the color and specs. It was never the same. This one was fine until I found out that we needed space for a second car seat. Traded her towards the next car in May of 2022. No regrets.

"I am 28. I've owned 7 cars (and 2 motorcycles!). 

Previous, in order:

- 2001 Chevrolet Cavalier Coupe. First car at 16. Mom fronted the money that I paid her back with. What a shit car, but learning manual as my first car was the best thing I could've done for myself. 

- 2003 Chrysler Neon. After being rear-ended pretty dramatically, I got myself a cheeky little Neon. Decent little shitbox. This is the one that I put a sick sound system in, with Focal speakers and a 12"" JL audio sub. 

- 2010 Hyundai Genesis Coupe 3.8. Fuckin loved this car. Tastefully modded it and kept the exterior in pristine condition. After 4 years of ownership and driving it literally across the country, I made an unsafe left hand turn at a yellow light. Insurance skyrocketed. Couldn't afford it anymore.

- 1995 Volkswagen Polo, for the Mongol Rally. Engine didn't fail us once. Ended its life in a junkyard in Estonia after faithfully taking us across Europe and Central Asia. 

- 2005 Pontiac Vibe GT. Took me forever to realize it had a 2zz, and that much fun could be had after 6000 rpm. Passed it on to my little sister.

- 1996 Saab 900 SE Turbo. Clutch was going. But fucking loved that car. Mostly spotless. This is the one I wish I didn't sell. Beautiful green with tan leather interior. 

Current:

- 2005 Pontiac Vibe GT. Passed back to me lmao.

- 2000 Toyota Mr2 Spyder 2zz swap. This is the one where I've been shafted by monkeywrenchracing. Thankfully, the fuckin SECOND ENGINE from them is now mechanically where it should be, and it's about to get remapped.",2024-01-16 05:15:25,"How many cars have you owned and how old are you?

2002 Ford Escape

2007 Ford Escape Hybrid

2021 Ford Bronco Sport Outerbanks

2023 Ford Bronco Sport Heritage Limited 

The Buick was gifted to me by my parents as my first car as an adult in 2001. Lost to too much front end damage worth it to fix after being run off the road.
 Significant other worked for Ford Credit so got a huge discount that precipitated the purchase of the nest 3 vechicles (Taurus was stolen, 02 Escape got too many miles and was about to expire it's warranty) 
I loved my 03 Escape, it had almost 200k miles and was very sadly lost to a rear ending from a texting driver in 2017, it had so much more life to it!
I got another Escape I found online, had wanted to try a Hybrid and it had super cool custom green leather interior I fell in love with. Lost that to an engine issue I wasn't aware of until castrophic failure.  
I wanted the Bronco Sport but wasn't in my plans for a couple years but then the Escape died and there was this beautiful Bronco Sport on the lot the day we lost the Escape...
The Heritage Bronco Sport was as close to a dream car I've been able to afford so the '21 had to be traded in for the one I really wanted vs the one I settled for.",2024-01-18 04:39:33,"How many cars have you owned and how old are you?

"My experience with the Mazdaspeed MX-5 is short.  I wanted more bolstering.  I hated that the turbo kicked in at high 2s to 3k rpm. I couldn't stand the gas mileage for the power I was getting.  I felt chassis flex.  

In short, I was spoiled by the Mr2s that I owned before.  I had a touch more bolstering, a touch less flex, +4 to +6mpg on less power, and more weight.  I preferred the mid engine set up.  It was more of a challenge.

If I had more of a budget, it would have been aftermarket seats.  I think the prior owner sold the MS seats.  I would have added a ton of bracing and added a hard top.  I remember the steering being more lively and quicker than my Mr2s, and the weight difference was very noticeable.  But, I'd still have to deal with the turbo lag, and as it turns out, it's not my preference, especially with such a gas mileage penalty.  I drove in dense areas and never got more than 22mpg.  I got 25-27 with my Camry motor Mr2s.  Slow, sure, but I got to basically floor it everywhere and not worry.

Ofc after the MS Mx-5, I eventually owned an '01 Mr2.  Best of both worlds.  I added a lot of braces including one that was the length of the wheelbase.   Strut towers front and rear.

"I do get it, if things are working right with the auto headlights (and its some pretty basic circuitry to get it working right) one shouldn't need to mess with the lights at all. Real estate on things like stalks is a premium, they should have as many important controls as necessary while still staying simple enough to quickly figure out. Most of the cars I've owned recently had the lights on/off/auto switch on the dashboard panels around the wheel but not actually on the stalks, which I feel is a good compromise of accessibility and staying out of the way as its not something I mess with every time I drive. 

Honestly, I'm not even one of those people who completely lament a lot of things getting put on the screen. Personally I like having a larger touchscreen in my car, it makes things like using the navigation system and understanding the map a heck of a lot easier than having a tiny little screen far away. But I do think there needs to be a balance of safety critical systems versus stuff you really shouldn't be messing with too much while you're driving anyways.

Good to know  you don't *need* to go into the settings, it is better that it has a quick access, but I still feel like headlights are one thing which still should have a physical control. I guess I missed that part of the manual, I just went straight to exterior lighting controls and it mentioned that menu and left off all other mentions of lights and made no mention of a physical switch so I figured that was the only way.",2023-08-25 14:09:16,"Hyundai recalls nearly 40,000 vehicles because software error can cause car to accelerate

Assuming you want one, then you just answered your own question. Most of the people who want something like this arent in a position to buy one, and most people who are in position to buy one dont want one.

The 2 door coupe market is already tiny, and the EV market is also a minority segment (<10% in the U.S, the biggest sports car market in the world), so when you overlap the two you get a puny market segment that wont have enough volume to justify the R&D and production of a mass produced vehicle like that.

The exceptions are niche toys for the uktra-rich, such as the Rimac.

"The biggest reasons that average people don't buy EVs are 1)  purchase price 2) charging opportunities 3) range anxiety. 

For an auto maker to make an EV coupe, they'd want to address at least one of these things. Otherwise it would not ""positively affect purchase intent"" - IE it wouldn't increase sales.

A coupe variant wouldn't be much cheaper. And it wouldn't be any easier to charge. 

Would it increase range?


In general, an EV's range is based around three (intrinsic) factors: 

- Weight

- Battery capacity

- Aerodynamics

Let's assume you're getting the same aero between a sedan and a coupe variant (reasonable). And let's assume that making the vehicle shorter does not decrease the total battery size (...less reasonable, but run with me). *How much will Two-Doorification reduce weight, and thus extend range?*

Well, here are some random examples of kerb weight differences from ICE vehicles with 2dr and 4dr variants:

2016 HONDA CIVIC - Touring, Automatic:

- 2dr: 2,888lbs
- 4dr: 2,923lbs

JEEP WRANGLER - Rubicon, Automatic:

- 2dr: 4,250lbs
- 4dr: 4,575 lbs

FORD F150 - 6.5' bed, 3.3L V8, RWD:

- Regular Cab: 4,564lbs
- Supercab: 4,810lbs

So to go from sedan to coupe, you're probably talking about a weight savings of like 100-300 pounds. 

That's not a huge deal in modern ICE vehicles that weigh ~3000pounds. It's even less noticeable in modern EVs that are *dummythicc*.

Let's take a really favorable example. The lightest Tesla (base Model 3) weighs 3,862lbs. Assuming you take off a full 300 pounds from that, you're still looking at only a 7.7% weight reduction. But that car has an EPA range of 272 miles. A 7.7% increase would bring it to 292. That's not a lot of benefit from losing your back door - or even your whole back seat.

And that's like your best-case scenario right now, since most EVs weigh way more, and most coupe-ifications involve less weight savings too.

...and designing a new variant like this costs a huge amount of money for the automaker. And in this case you might have to design and test a bespoke shorter-length battery pack, which would cost... yeah.

Would people buy EV coupes? Yeah. With such modest incentives, would they rather buy a coupe than a sedan? Probably almost never.

The main reason people bought ICE coupes was because they did things ICE sedans couldn't do - handle better due to shorter wheelbase or significantly lighter kerb weight, better engine efficiency (faster, also better 'range') due to better aero or lighter kerb weight. Frankly I think this hasn't been true for decades now - which is why most people don't buy coupes today - or when they do, a lot of it is living in the aesthetic slipstream of previous generations. It's not really that EVs introduce new disincentives to buy a coupe - it's that no new disincentives were needed, and EVs just make that all that more apparent.",2024-01-08 16:25:15,"Why are there no 2 Door Coupe EVs

"Aside from what others have said, it's also extremely cost prohibitive to make any coupe (EV or ICE). They know it tailors to car enthusiasts for the most part and I'm sure you've seen how picky, finicky, and contradictory we are. It has to handle well, have ample power, ""feels"" great to drive, have good ergonomics for the driver more than the similarly priced SUV/Crossover, etc. any combination of most or ideally all of the above.

That requires a lot of R&D, for not a lot of return because again, car enthusiasts are finicky. Much easier to copy and paste an existing interior onto a slightly raised platform of an existing car, give it some slapdash suspension that is adequate for comfort, and basically say ""good enough"" for everything else.

"Coupes are such a tiny percentage of the market. A better question might be where have all the coupes gone?

I think part of it is because most modern coupes that I've seen are harder to live with daily. Sure, my 3rd gen Camaro has limited backseat space, but you can fit a ton of shit in the hatch. Same with my old 4th gen Camaro and C7. My C7 was used for Costco a lot and I had no problems fitting stuff in there. I could go on a weekend trip at the beach and stop at Costco on the way back with me and the wife and still not have any issues. But my old 6th gen Camaro? Good luck fitting anything in the trunk, and you're certainly not putting any size adult in the backseat.

Another example is the G87 vs F87 M2. The interior is no longer accommodating of adults in the backseat. Not every potential buyer cares, but I imagine a lot of people that are looking to daily drive their M2 might. An M4 is easier as an only car, but it's a large step in price over the M2 and it's more expensive and not as easy to live with than an M3 (and maybe doesn't look as good either because it doesn't have those wide hips).

If it becomes your secondary car, then a lot of that stuff becomes less important and you buy it for other reasons like driver engagement, steering feel, and for lack of a better term, ICE noises. EVs for the most part aren't known for their driver engagement. I'm sure this will all change over time and they will make engaging EV sports cars.",2024-01-08 14:27:15,"Why are there no 2 Door Coupe EVs

You don't buy the car for only the number of people, but luggage and thinking ahead.

"> Even in the luxury space, coupes that aren't second/third-car sports cars are essentially dead. They either get two more doors and become ""4-door coupes"" or else are canned.

If by luxury you mean MB/BMW/Audi/Lexus, then yeah those brands have some trouble at the top end of their range. The S-class coupe was canceled and rumor is there won't be a new 8 series after this generation. But above that at the ultra-luxury segment sales are still good and companies are investing significant resources into new coupes - the GT class. Rolls Royce, Aston Martin, Ferrari, and Maserati have all released brand new coupes over the past year (well convertible for Ferrari but it's the same segment). And Mercedes just turned the AMG GT from a sports car to a grand tourer, so they haven't given up yet. There's still desirability to luxury coupes that aren't sports cars, but you have to go *way* upmarket at basically the top end of luxury segment.",2024-01-08 17:33:39,"Why are there no 2 Door Coupe EVs

Unsatisfactory noise insulation, interior ambience not quite as good as others in a similar price range (especially the case for the s and the x) Not that its that bad in these areas, but theres better. 

And no one needs sub 3.5 0-60 for a daily. Id gladly add a couple of seconds to that figure for more creature comforts.",2023-08-01 15:55:51,"After a bunch of shopping around, I just leased a BMW i4 e35 to replace my Tesla as my new daily




I've been in the fortunate position to have a weekend fun car + daily 2 car garage for a while. For a daily Tesla Model 3 for 4 years until I sold it last summer for almost how much I paid for it initially, right before I moved to another country.

Now I'm back in the States and I need another daily again. No, despite what you hear the 718 GTS is a terrible daily driver, especially a manual one in this atrocious Pacific Northwest traffic. After 2 weeks my left calf is now visibly larger than my right one, thanks to the heavy clutch. And getting around 16 mpg when gas price is $6/gallon doesn't feel good either.

The following are the cars I considered and drove:

**Tesla Model 3**: Best cost/performance EV powertrain in the business. A Model 3 Performance is 15% cheaper than a Kia EV6 GT and 30% cheaper than a BMW i4 M50, while having longer range and the Tesla charger network. But I want something different this time around. I wanted something with a *premium* interior and good noise insulation, two things that I disliked the most about the Model 3. 

**Kia EV6**: Great packaging and good platform. Looks good from the outside, a ton of space inside, decent range and very good value. The interior material/build quality feels cheap. However the deal breaker was the seats. Something was protruding weirdly in the back against my lower spine and I couldn't get comfortable no matter what. Tried lumbar adjustment, different car, etc, didn't go away. Can't buy a car that I don't feel comfortable sitting in.

**Hyundai Ioniq 5**: Great car. Slightly better than the Kia EV6 in many ways and feels more premium. However I had the *exact* issue with the seats (probably same source). No go for me personally, but I highly recommend it.

**Genesis GV60**: Now this was a shockingly good car. I liked the polarizing exterior design and the interior was drop dead gorgeous, with details and materials that punch far above its segment. The powertrain was fantastic too with acceptable range and good performance. The Advanced Trim is the sweet spot imo. This was my runner up, despite being the only crossover I considered.

**2024 Polestar 2**: Good powertrain and decent cabin tech. It's about $5-10k overpriced but that's what happens when you have such a high tariff against Made in China cars. The car was fun to drive but the packaging was a complete and total disaster. I've never seen a car that size being so cramped inside. I'm 5'9 and 145lbs and yet I always hit my head or my knee on my way getting in. Even inside it feels suffocating. Backseats are extremely uncomfortable and rear headroom is comparable to most 2+2 coupes instead of an actual sedan. Volvo did such a terrible and disappointing job with the whole design and packaging. 

**BMW i4 M50**: I can't believe I'm saying this, but the i4's exterior has grown on me. The M50 trim, being the top dog, is an incredible EV sports sedan. It's every bit as fast, if not slightly faster than a Model 3 Performance. However it does feel over weight and the car is a bit overpriced at $80k. Due to it not being a dedicated EV platform it also has a little bit packaging issue (rear head room not great, big transmission tunnel in car), but nowhere as bad as the Polestar (which ironically *was* a dedicated EV platform). Two things that I liked the most were the BMW cabin tech (if you get it fully loaded) and the best-in-class cabin insulation. 

**BMW i4 e40**: I liked this so much more than I expected. Being RWD and 400lbs lighter, it handles far more agile than the M50, with more than enough power to never feel slow for a daily. Car and Driver tested 4.8s 0-60 and with the EV response it feels faster in real life than even a RWD M340i. It has all the good stuff I cared about from the i4 M50 while having longer range and lower cost. 


**BMW i4 e35**: This was a new trim BMW introduced recently. I was on the verge of buying the i4 e40 when I discovered this trim. For around $8k-10k less (partially thanks to BMW passing through the full $7500 lease credit on the e35 model only) you get a smaller battery with 25 miles lower range, and 50 less HP that results in 0.3s slower 0-60. Everything else is the same, from design to options. It met all my personal needs  and is of great value when compared to the e40, so I changed my mind and snatched one of these instead.

So far so good, I'll probably write a more in-depth review after a couple weeks.

Here I am with my EV6 scratching my head as to what in the seat could have possibly been poking you in the back.  Ya got me!!  But it's nice to hear that you otherwise liked both it and the Ioniq 5.,2023-08-01 15:18:22,"After a bunch of shopping around, I just leased a BMW i4 e35 to replace my Tesla as my new daily




I've been in the fortunate position to have a weekend fun car + daily 2 car garage for a while. For a daily Tesla Model 3 for 4 years until I sold it last summer for almost how much I paid for it initially, right before I moved to another country.

Now I'm back in the States and I need another daily again. No, despite what you hear the 718 GTS is a terrible daily driver, especially a manual one in this atrocious Pacific Northwest traffic. After 2 weeks my left calf is now visibly larger than my right one, thanks to the heavy clutch. And getting around 16 mpg when gas price is $6/gallon doesn't feel good either.

The following are the cars I considered and drove:

**Tesla Model 3**: Best cost/performance EV powertrain in the business. A Model 3 Performance is 15% cheaper than a Kia EV6 GT and 30% cheaper than a BMW i4 M50, while having longer range and the Tesla charger network. But I want something different this time around. I wanted something with a *premium* interior and good noise insulation, two things that I disliked the most about the Model 3. 

**Kia EV6**: Great packaging and good platform. Looks good from the outside, a ton of space inside, decent range and very good value. The interior material/build quality feels cheap. However the deal breaker was the seats. Something was protruding weirdly in the back against my lower spine and I couldn't get comfortable no matter what. Tried lumbar adjustment, different car, etc, didn't go away. Can't buy a car that I don't feel comfortable sitting in.

**Hyundai Ioniq 5**: Great car. Slightly better than the Kia EV6 in many ways and feels more premium. However I had the *exact* issue with the seats (probably same source). No go for me personally, but I highly recommend it.

**Genesis GV60**: Now this was a shockingly good car. I liked the polarizing exterior design and the interior was drop dead gorgeous, with details and materials that punch far above its segment. The powertrain was fantastic too with acceptable range and good performance. The Advanced Trim is the sweet spot imo. This was my runner up, despite being the only crossover I considered.

**2024 Polestar 2**: Good powertrain and decent cabin tech. It's about $5-10k overpriced but that's what happens when you have such a high tariff against Made in China cars. The car was fun to drive but the packaging was a complete and total disaster. I've never seen a car that size being so cramped inside. I'm 5'9 and 145lbs and yet I always hit my head or my knee on my way getting in. Even inside it feels suffocating. Backseats are extremely uncomfortable and rear headroom is comparable to most 2+2 coupes instead of an actual sedan. Volvo did such a terrible and disappointing job with the whole design and packaging. 

**BMW i4 M50**: I can't believe I'm saying this, but the i4's exterior has grown on me. The M50 trim, being the top dog, is an incredible EV sports sedan. It's every bit as fast, if not slightly faster than a Model 3 Performance. However it does feel over weight and the car is a bit overpriced at $80k. Due to it not being a dedicated EV platform it also has a little bit packaging issue (rear head room not great, big transmission tunnel in car), but nowhere as bad as the Polestar (which ironically *was* a dedicated EV platform). Two things that I liked the most were the BMW cabin tech (if you get it fully loaded) and the best-in-class cabin insulation. 

**BMW i4 e40**: I liked this so much more than I expected. Being RWD and 400lbs lighter, it handles far more agile than the M50, with more than enough power to never feel slow for a daily. Car and Driver tested 4.8s 0-60 and with the EV response it feels faster in real life than even a RWD M340i. It has all the good stuff I cared about from the i4 M50 while having longer range and lower cost.

"I owned a Model 3 for 4 years, and I didnt really use the supercharger network. So thats not too much of a factor for me.

As far as range go, at least the BMW is about the same as the Tesla in real life, and more than what I need for a daily.

Performance wise 0-60 just doesnt matter that much to many people. Ive driven all the performance Tesla including the Plaid, and its just too fast to really matter for daily driving. Its cool to impress your passengers though.

So after all that, it comes down to the rest of the car. And I find the other aspects, such as interior and technology, more important to me.",2023-08-03 23:46:04,"After a bunch of shopping around, I just leased a BMW i4 e35 to replace my Tesla as my new daily

Now I'm back in the States and I need another daily again. No, despite what you hear the 718 GTS is a terrible daily driver, especially a manual one in this atrocious Pacific Northwest traffic. After 2 weeks my left calf is now visibly larger than my right one, thanks to the heavy clutch. And getting around 16 mpg when gas price is $6/gallon doesn't feel good either.

The following are the cars I considered and drove:

**Tesla Model 3**: Best cost/performance EV powertrain in the business. A Model 3 Performance is 15% cheaper than a Kia EV6 GT and 30% cheaper than a BMW i4 M50, while having longer range and the Tesla charger network. But I want something different this time around. I wanted something with a *premium* interior and good noise insulation, two things that I disliked the most about the Model 3. 

**Kia EV6**: Great packaging and good platform. Looks good from the outside, a ton of space inside, decent range and very good value. The interior material/build quality feels cheap. However the deal breaker was the seats. Something was protruding weirdly in the back against my lower spine and I couldn't get comfortable no matter what. Tried lumbar adjustment, different car, etc, didn't go away. Can't buy a car that I don't feel comfortable sitting in.

**Hyundai Ioniq 5**: Great car. Slightly better than the Kia EV6 in many ways and feels more premium. However I had the *exact* issue with the seats (probably same source). No go for me personally, but I highly recommend it.

**Genesis GV60**: Now this was a shockingly good car. I liked the polarizing exterior design and the interior was drop dead gorgeous, with details and materials that punch far above its segment. The powertrain was fantastic too with acceptable range and good performance. The Advanced Trim is the sweet spot imo. This was my runner up, despite being the only crossover I considered.

**2024 Polestar 2**: Good powertrain and decent cabin tech. It's about $5-10k overpriced but that's what happens when you have such a high tariff against Made in China cars. The car was fun to drive but the packaging was a complete and total disaster. I've never seen a car that size being so cramped inside. I'm 5'9 and 145lbs and yet I always hit my head or my knee on my way getting in. Even inside it feels suffocating. Backseats are extremely uncomfortable and rear headroom is comparable to most 2+2 coupes instead of an actual sedan. Volvo did such a terrible and disappointing job with the whole design and packaging. 

**BMW i4 M50**: I can't believe I'm saying this, but the i4's exterior has grown on me. The M50 trim, being the top dog, is an incredible EV sports sedan. It's every bit as fast, if not slightly faster than a Model 3 Performance. However it does feel over weight and the car is a bit overpriced at $80k. Due to it not being a dedicated EV platform it also has a little bit packaging issue (rear head room not great, big transmission tunnel in car), but nowhere as bad as the Polestar (which ironically *was* a dedicated EV platform). Two things that I liked the most were the BMW cabin tech (if you get it fully loaded) and the best-in-class cabin insulation. 

**BMW i4 e40**: I liked this so much more than I expected. Being RWD and 400lbs lighter, it handles far more agile than the M50, with more than enough power to never feel slow for a daily. Car and Driver tested 4.8s 0-60 and with the EV response it feels faster in real life than even a RWD M340i. It has all the good stuff I cared about from the i4 M50 while having longer range and lower cost. 


**BMW i4 e35**: This was a new trim BMW introduced recently. I was on the verge of buying the i4 e40 when I discovered this trim. For around $8k-10k less (partially thanks to BMW passing through the full $7500 lease credit on the e35 model only) you get a smaller battery with 25 miles lower range, and 50 less HP that results in 0.3s slower 0-60. Everything else is the same, from design to options. It met all my personal needs  and is of great value when compared to the e40, so I changed my mind and snatched one of these instead.

So far so good, I'll probably write a more in-depth review after a couple weeks.

"I took a week off of work and did a cross-country trip with my friends for SCCA Time Trials Nationals.  It was memorable for a few reasons, both good and bad.

* Tow vehicle snapped four of five wheel studs on passenger rear wheel 500 miles from our destination
* Fixing said wheel studs with borrowed parts from our track cars and miraculously making it the remaining 500 miles with zero issues
* Having multiple days of track sessions with friends, comparing times, sharing strategies, and shaving seconds to find the absolute limit of our cars & skills
* Helping other competitors with track-side repairs late into the night and the raucous celebratory dinner afterwords
* Stealing an event sign on the way out
* Blowing a coolant connector on my tow vehicle at nearly the same spot the wheel studs broke, and yet again robbing parts from the track cars to get another 500 miles home
* Receiving the 2k towing miles oil report from my tow vehicle and having *10x* the amount of wear materials in the oil,  Blackstone Labs literally said ""drive with caution""

"So a friend of my joined the Coast Guard this year, and you'll already know that joining the armed forces of course means new car time. Something about young men and disposable income tends to prompt such purchases.

But from him, I expected perhaps a Jeep of some kind, as he really loves the outdoors and whatnot, and the history behind them (hence why he wasn't nearly so interested in something like the Bronco). Or perhaps the Kia Stinger. He'd been raving on and on about that car for a while, actually being the reason I even knew about it at all.

And then he completely threw out all my notions when he sent me an eBay listing. 

1984 Chevy Corvette. In brown.

I legitimately didn't know what to make of it. We'd talked about them before, me telling him if I bought an older car, it'd be something like it or the Fiero. Relatively simple, but still nice looking. Not to crazy to drive and get in trouble in, and plenty of parts available in case I do.

But I didn't know he was so interested in them he would entertain the thought of buying it.

Much less have already put down a bid of seven thousand. On a 80's American car. Which he has not inspected in person.

This is the makings of a man who's put himself into a terrible financial state...

...except no he didn't.

He already had some money saved up, and took out a small loan to pay the difference. And since he's in the Coast Guard, he has guaranteed (obligated) work for at least a few years. 

And it's not like he'll be struggling to pay off the rest of his bills for quite a while: the Coast Guard pays for everything he needs. Food, housing, some of his clothes: Hell, he even gets some money for transportation, so he could take an Uber if the car left him stranded.

And the car itself, perfectly fine. I rode in him with it, it looked good, ran good, nothing was obviously wrong or missing...

...he made a stupid decision, and got away with it.

As someone's whose borrowed Sentra had its transmission begin to crap out, and as such was scrapped, leaving me ferried by family/borrowing over long distances...and as such also unable to Doordash (not that it's worth a damn anymore anyways)...yeah, I was a bit miffed.

"Yes, the GT3 RS can only be driven at the Experience Center when paired with a GT3 so I drove both each time. I probably have about 80-90 mins of seat time in each-- it's basically at the instructors' discretion how much time they let you spend in each car and the first guy was much more generous with the RS lol. My comments on the aero in this post are from driving both, back to back.

I haven't driven a non-winged car on this track so it's hard to say how much the aero helps on the GT3, but comparing the two directly the downforce is very noticeable on the RS, even at speeds below 100mph (top speed on their circuit is around 100-105). I imagine on a faster course the RS could easily be 15-20mph faster through higher speed turns.

I didn't get to play with the settings like DRS and damping very much - the first time, I didn't feel super comfortable but the instructor set some damping settings after a while, and the second time I just totally forgot. I was pretty satisfied with my time in the RS immediately after my second go and wasn't planning to return because I don't think there's much more for me to do there, but now remembering there's DRS and damping settings to be played with I might have to go back again next year .",2023-12-31 14:55:30,"Its 12/31st where I am already.

"Oh yeah UIDS should be the best solution for oil starvation.

I've owned my manual 986 2.5L for three years and have driven is from 182 000 km to 201 000 km so far. It's my summer daily driver.

I've had nothing too major, when I bought the car it had some cheap off brand MAF which caused the car to run rich. After Installing a bosch MAF it was okay for a while until I replaced the air filter. Turns out the air box has not the best design and when I changed the filter some leafs dropped to the bottom of the airbox and got stuck to the mesh before the MAF causing rich condition.

I have replaced engine and transmission mounts, the water pump and the starter's solenoid started to stick when hot so I had to rebuild it. Also the interior and the folding top are starting to show their age. 

Right now I'm in the process of dropping the gearbox to change the IMS bearing as it has always been a bit whiny at around 2000 rpm.

"I get that it's trying to do something different, modernizing the original Neue Classe, but this just doesn't work. 

The grille itself looks pure BMW! it's good and the octagonal corners match BMWs current design language. It could look good but those headlight strips  completely klashe with the shape of the car. The line from the hood sill goes through the headlights and disappears into the flat, featureless lower clip. A more traditional headlight shape, not necessarily round, but at least more in line with BMWs current aesthetic, would break that line and make the front coherent.

As it is, it seems to take design cues from BMW's WEC Hypercar prototype, which doesn't work on this shape.

And frankly the whole shape of the car is a bit oddly proportioned. I appreciate the Hoffmeister kink, but the slope of the roof to the trunk doesn't feel very BMW, but rather like a generic, quirky, perhaps Japanese concept EV.",2023-09-02 14:15:11,"BMW Vision Neue Klasse revealed

Other posters note pickups are rather not aerodynamic. So true, and they end up with absurdly large batteries given the workload they are designed for.

Fords Maverick success bolsters this claim. 

The optimized EV would have narrow tires and/or lower ground clearance and lower profile. EVs often have pop-out for aero door handles. Another quirk soon will be no side mirrors as NHTSA is being prodded by its counterpart agency FMCSA to allow camera monitoring systems in place of as-yet-still-mandated side mirrors. FMCSA gave an exemption for select commercial truck operators to remove the manufacturer-required mirrors on truck tractors to pilot camera systemsin a kind of multi year pilot study. In cab monitor displays provide the side vision, with a number of potential benefits. Image processing may enhance night or sun glare vision, better field of view, pedestrian/motorcycle/bicycle ID and alerts, and more. I expect this to prove out and change the mandated standards.

From my experience, the Model S today is a nice car to be in. You're not wrong to say Tesla's interiors were not up to par, this was once true, but today everything is soft touch or metal inside.

Nice ground clearance, same 36 foot turning circle (Model Y is 40 foot), back doors are way easier to get car seats in and out of. More towing capacity too! Both cars have wireless CarPlay, but it really shines with the bigger screen in the ID.4. CarPlay is weirdly missing on Model Y.

Oh yeah, the heated steering wheel works way better in the ID.4, it was only warm in a couple spots on the RAV4, by like 3 and 9 oclock, but its perfectly consistent all around with the ID.4. I live in New Hampshire, love having a heated steering wheel. I set it to automatically turn on the heated seats and steering wheel when its cold out.

Just make sure your ID.4 got the 3.1 update and the infotainment isnt all that bad. The early bad press helped drive down used prices.",2024-01-12 15:10:50,"The 15 Bestselling EVs of 2023

"I used to own what I considered the best looking 4 door car available, a 2019 Audi RS5 sportback. Man, that car was special, I absolutely adored everything about it. Then, one day I came back to my car after getting my hair cut and there was a white Taycan parked next to me, I couldn't take my eyes off it. My local Porsche dealer had a used '20 Taycan 4S but it was silver, the same colour as my RS5, so there was no worries that I would buy it when I went to check it out. So, yeah, you can probably guess how that worked out. I do miss the RS5 but I am totally smitten by the Taycan, I still feel the need to pinch myself when I see her, and the best part is that she drives just as good as she looks!

"I visited a Chery dealership in Ensenada, BC back in June. The experience felt very upscale from the moment I stepped into the showroom. Even though I told the staff that I was visiting from the US and just wanted to check out the vehicles out of curiosity, they treated me as if I were a customer who was actively looking to buy a car. They showed me a few models, including the new Omoda. I got to fire them up, check out the infotainment system, and took a few pictures with the cars. 

Overall, I'd say the brand, one of the oldest Chinese car brands, is a formidable competitor to the Koreans. The build quality and choice of materials was on par with a top trim Hyundai or Kia, but at a lower price, and with a MUCH better dealership experience. The manager of the dealership actually told me that there is internal discussion about expansion to the United States and Canada, but exact dates are still unknown. If they can maintain the same dealership experience, they'll easily blow the Koreans out of the water. Remember, the Korean brands faced the same stigma when they first came to the USA, but they overcame it.

"I actually had this debate on Reddit last week or the week before on this topic, hence why I had a look over the weekend to confirm my experience. I know the measurements suggest the Model 3 to be spacious, but it's simply not my experience in person.

My theory is that the Model 3 had a higher floor and hence less distance between the seat and the floor. When you sit closer to the floor, your legs extend further forward so it takes up more space in the longitudinal direction.

I'll have to check out the current generation 3 series in person, but I drove a F80 M3 for 10 days previously, and I found that to have adequate rear seats.",2023-03-17 08:50:00,"Any thoughts on Polestar?

"I sat in the non-driving mock up of this they had at the Sydney Polestar centre. The interior is superb and feels every bit like a $150k car. It is at least on par with similarly priced ICE SUVs like the GLE, X5 etc. 

The thing that shits me with Polestar is they have quite a competitive entry price to get into the 2 but you then need to add $20k of options. Even adaptive cruise isn't standard and only comes in a $3.5k option pack! They also bundle up stuff like an electrically adjustable steering wheel which is useful if you have 2 drivers but you can only get it in an $8k option pack that comes with a bunch of shit I don't want.",2023-12-21 01:50:17,"2025 Polestar 3 electric SUV pricing confirmed for Australia

"UPDATE: Ive now driven the Polestar. I thought it was the dual motor but apparently it was just the FWD. Quite liked it, very comfortable car and more than quick enough. By coincidence I got called by my local Tesla representative saying that they actually just took delivery of Ys for test driving today as well. Im booked in to try one on Wednesday, Ill update this post for those that are interested.

Another (quick) update: drove the C40 recharge dual motor today (dealer didnt have an XC). Very quick car, has off-road mode which was cool. 8 month lead time though - went to the motorcycle dealers across the road after to check out a KTM. A MY pulled up outside the vinnies nearby and I chatted to the owner - nice lad, let me sit in the drivers seat. Honestly loved it, looking forward to the test drive on Wednesday. I would say the leather seats went a long way towards the feel of the car - the P2 and Volvo had comfortable cloth seats, but they made it feel very budget.

Gday all, 

Hoping to take advantage of the 0 FBT on EVs with a Novated lease. With the long wait times on the XC40 recharge Ive narrowed it down to: 

- Base Tesla Model 3 (Red)
- Polestar 2 RWD with pilot pack 
- Long Range Tesla Model Y (Red) 

Thats the both the size and the cost order - the 3 being the smallest (and very cheap), the Y being the most expensive. The range of all 3 is about the same. 

Unfortunately Tesla dont offer test drives where I am, but Ive been in a 3 before. 

I mostly plan on highway driving, I do sports like MTB but Im happy to throw those on roof racks. My car before was a Micra and honestly I had no issues. 

Here in Aus, Tesla seem to have better build than the states. Not sure how true this is. 

My main questions are: 

- Is the Polestar really worth the now 20k premium over the 3? 

- Does the lack of keys, controls and dash with the Teslas get annoying? 

- Resale wise Im not sure how Polestar or the 3 will hold up. Come the end of the lease, a good trade in price makes things easier. 

- The Tesla tech seems pretty impressive. Is autopilot something thats hard to live without once you have it?

- Which car would you recommend? The 3 seems a bargain, the P2 seems like its more premium, and the Y has lots of room. However all seem like they have annoyances and its difficult to find a good comparison of the tradeoffs. 

Looks wise I think theyre all good looking cars. Though, I wish the glass roof was standard on the Polestar.

"The Polestar 2 is worth $20k less than the Tesla, not more. They did some things right, the interior materials and quality is good, and it looks nice, but because they built it on an ICE platform, it's just too compromised, and the 2023 updates won't fix many of the issues. Compared to the Tesla it's slow and inefficient, the 2023 update will improve efficiency, but even then in real life it won't compete in terms of range or performance.  It can't because of its legacy platform and weight. It also charges significantly slower than the 3/Y. Carwow did a range test comaprison of the 2021 models, and the Model 3 SR+ (which has less range current RWD) travelled significantly further on a charge at motorway speed, than the long range big battery Polestar 2. It was a destruction. 

https://fb.watch/lMGtsBOSMI/?mibextid=NnVzG8

The Model 3 is imminently due an upgrade too (the Highland) which uses a new type of batteries and increased capacity (amongst other unannounced things), so will be a huge upgrade again. 

But the biggest issue with the Polestar 2 is actually something you mentioned OP, the space. You said the Model 3 was the smallest car, and that may be true on the outside (although it is wide), but on the inside it's cavernous compared to the Polestar 2. The interior of the Polestar is snug in the front, but the back is the real issue. Because it's a legacy ICE platform, it has a redundant transmission tunnel, which renders the middle  rear seat basically useless (as does the interior width), and the leg room is bad, but by far the worst is the roof line, which means if you're my height (183cm) or even a bit shorter, the roof headliner sides along the glass sunroof actually interfere with where you head should go. You either have to sit with your head leaning inwards, or rest your head along on roof. Extremely uncomfortable. 

Obviously the elephant in the room is the supercharger network, which is vastly superior to other charging networks, and just works. It makes any Tesla a true road tripping beast. But some selected sites are open to other brands, and I think they'll open it completely eventually. But you're rolling a dice on that. Have EV road tripped extensively throughout South Eastern Australia, I can tell you superchargers are without peer, and you often have issues with other brands, whether it be speed, the fact they're broken, or you have to wait for them because there is only one available. 

Now I may sound like a Tesla fan boy, but that's not entirely true, and what I said is based on fact. I'm in the UK at the moment, and spent hours looking over all the EVs on sale now and in the next few years at Electirc Avenue at the Goodwood Festival of speed (amongst looking at many other cars). The Polestar 3 was magnificent, it addresses all the Polestar 2 issues, and is a true competitor to Tesla, so much so that I'm buying Polestar shares today. It's super expensive, and is Model Y sized, but Model X money, but it's a better car than the Model Y. This is the first car that's actually caught up, and Tesla needs to look over their shoulder. The Lotus Eletre was also absolutely fantastic.  I spent 20 minutes talking to a Lotus engineer, and they truly get EVs in the same way Polestar now do and Tesla do. It's super expensive but it's phenomenal. A magnificent first effort. 

On the flip side the Mercdedes EQS SUV was a huge disappointment. It was luxurious for sure, but it was tiny in the back seats for a supposed S class of SUVs, narrow, lacking leg room, about the same legroom as an E class, not S class, but narrower than an E class.

So while I do own a Tesla, I don't see my self as blinded, and hope to offer you a balanced perspective. If you do end up choosing a Tesla, DM me and I can provide you with a referral code which will give you $500 off and 1500km of supercharging credits. Hope this was helpful.",2023-07-14 07:11:05,"Polestar 2 or Tesla

"Given the urgency of your situation I think it's best to just go on a test drive and really see which suits you better. 

I recommend at least a 30 minute test drive to ensure the seats are suited for your physique - no car is good enough if you can't get comfortable!

Also the P2 needs a few option boxes ticked otherwise it is quite barebones - the updated model fixes that but you don't have the luxury of waiting so keep this in mind!

It's a nice car.

However my test drive was full of a lot of ""Eh, I don't really like *that* part of this""

Anyways.

#First Impressions

It's smaller in person.

Definitely looks and feels smaller and lower than a Model 3.

The boot and froot are smaller as well.

They do look nice, and the blue is significantly nicer in person than the website and pictures show.

#Interior

The interior is possibly one of the nicest I've sat in with any new car.

The Gold Seatbelts are a nice bit of wank.

The centre console has 1 cupholder and an armrest, or 2 cupholders and no armrest. No Old El Paso stuff here.

The electric seat is only on the drivers side.

The gear selector is awkward, I wanted to use it as a hand rest while driving.

The roof narrows a *lot* at the top. It feels like it's coming in on you.

I drove the glass roof, I feel I personally would have been claustrophobic in the full metal roof.

#Visibility

Forward? Excellent.

Everywhere else? Fucking horrible.

The mirrors are about the size of my hand, and only the corners are convex, so it's field of view is horrible.

I had to *constantly* anxiously head check to get a view I wanted, over my shoulder, and so I had good time to study the B-Pillar, which is in the way of a head check.

Looking at the windscreen mirror? No idea why it exists, it's useless. You get an area the size of a phone book to look through, so unless someone is tailgating you, you have no idea they're there.

#Back seats

Me, a 175cm Adult male, would not be able to comfortably sit on a long trip in the back (say, Brisbane to Gold Coast, or Gold Coast to Sunshine Coast)

I also think that the space and shape would seriously affect your decision on which rear facing child seat to buy.

#Tech

As expected, it's nice.

This one had the traffic sign recognition, which was all good, until I was in traffic, doing 80, and there was a traffic control ute in the next lane.

It kept picking up the 40 sign in the back of his ute and beeping to tell me I was speeding.

The blind spot monitor failed to pick up 3 motorcycles that were next to me, where other cars would activate the light.

The integration of maps to the dashboard is excellent, but I don't know what I would otherwise have on the giant centre screen.

It's all Android Auto based, so there's that.

But it's still wired Android Auto, in a time when you can buy a farm truck with wireless Android Auto. Which is disappointing.

#Power

It's got it.

It's got shitloads.

It has to be the most fun Electric Car I have ever driven.

But it's not as finessed as the Tesla, it's not as delicate as the Jaaaaaaag.

It is literally punching you in the face, slamming your head back, snapping your neck like Thor himself just hit you in the face with Mjolnir.

It's not as fun.

There is no hesitation, no ""We'll let you think it's a petrol car for 0.25 microseconds""

If you foot to the floor, that accelerator becomes an on-off switch.

But Holy Moses can she scoot.

The blind spot monitor failed to pick up 3 motorcycles that were next to me, where other cars would activate the light.

The integration of maps to the dashboard is excellent, but I don't know what I would otherwise have on the giant centre screen.

It's all Android Auto based, so there's that.

But it's still wired Android Auto, in a time when you can buy a farm truck with wireless Android Auto. Which is disappointing.

#Power

It's got it.

It's got shitloads.

It has to be the most fun Electric Car I have ever driven.

But it's not as finessed as the Tesla, it's not as delicate as the Jaaaaaaag.

It is literally punching you in the face, slamming your head back, snapping your neck like Thor himself just hit you in the face with Mjolnir.

It's not as fun.

There is no hesitation, no ""We'll let you think it's a petrol car for 0.25 microseconds""

If you foot to the floor, that accelerator becomes an on-off switch.

But Holy Moses can she scoot.

#Final thoughts

Great DINK car, great post Kid Seat to Pre-Teen car, before kids get tall.

Not much room for kid seats, horrible opening to stick a kid in.

You'd be limited on pram choice by boot space.

It was a bucket of fun to drive.

It hasn't got as much room as the Model 3, it's direct competitor.

If I had to pick, with nothing else considered, as a family car.

Model 3.

If I wanted something fun, sporty, for me and my wife.

Hey all, 

In [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsAustralia/comments/14z2uad/polestar_2_or_tesla/) I asked for advice on Polestar 2 vs. Tesla for the purposes of a novated lease (taking advantage of the FBT exemption). I thought I'd do a first impressions of each from my test drives of the cars. For reference I ended up ordering a Model Y Long Range Dual Motor.

# Polestar 2 MY 2023 Single Motor Long Range w/ Pilot Pack

Nice comfy car, I didn't mind the centre console. Came with a big key fob and a little key fob which was cool. Dash was nice. Plenty quick - actually thought it was the dual motor. 

Pro's: 

* Car stuff like a real dash, key fob, and wiper stalk was nice to have.
* Tech stuff worked well\* like the phone integration with the digital dash was cool.
* Tailgate had the foot-opener thing.

Con's: 

* Storage was honestly lacking. With the seats folded I doubt you'd fit a MTB in there. 
* No leather seats actually made it feel quite a bit less premium.
* Bit expensive for what you get I think - Pilot Pack as an optional extra is a joke. Also the state of the 360 camera situation was straight from Aliexpress in terms of quality. The cameras are more or less useless.

\*It worked well... after I restarted the central screen. Trawling owners forums this isn't an uncommon procedure unfortunately.

# Volvo C40 Recharge Dual Motor

Same platform as the Polestar but different body. I wanted to test drive the XC40 but the C40 just has a slightly lower roof in the rear. Comfortable, and the glass roof did make it feel more spacious than the P2. 

Pro's:

* Same as the P2 in terms of 'car stuff' like dash, keyfob, controls.
* Back seats actually had a reasonable amount of room unlike the P2. 
* It has an off-road mode which was cool - not that I'd take it seriously off-road but I'd be confident with getting to a hike. 

Con's: 

* The UI is worse than the polestars in annoying little ways. For example the dash map only takes up a 1:1 square whereas the P2 was full width (small thing but it stood out a bit). Even if I didn't have the P2 for comparison I'd be left wondering 'why' - and when you hide the dash map you're just left with a big black void (the P2 at least made the gauges bigger).
* Also no leather seats on a $90k car. The glass roof helped make it feel nicer though.
* The 360 cameras suck here too, to the point where they actually make parking harder. Even just switching it to be a straight reversing cam doesn't fix it because the camera quality is so bad. 

# Tesla Model Y RWD w/ White Interior

Blindingly bright white interior but easily the roomiest of the lot - people are using them as campers. Quick enough and the iPad in the middle as a speedo was actually alright (even though I thought I'd hate it). 

Pro's:

* So much space for storage compared to the other offerings, think a full-size CR-V. The camper-mattresses you can put in these are a double-bed size. Lots of places to put stuff too.
* Interior was a nice place to be. 
* iPad worked alright and they laid it out cleverly (but... more on this in Con's) 

Con's:

* iPad is too clever in some ways - a full-on Spotify UI with a QWERTY keyboard is a lot to take in while driving. The drivers side half is pared-back and simple, the passenger half is a full-on laptop. 
* Keycard or phone only - though I've heard from owners it works alright when you give in. I like a nice fob though, makes me want to drive the car. 
* All these cameras and no 360 view? I don't trust the lack of radar either - it takes till you're way too close for the cameras to register an obstacle. At least the reversing camera has a good view. 

# Tesla Model 3 RWD

Sits lower than the Y and actually quite a bit quicker! Felt more premium for some reason, maybe it was the black seats? Having said all that the boot and its opening are tiny. 

Pro's: 

* Feels properly quick and fun. 
* It's a mid-size sedan with big-size sedan front occupant space.
* Roughly the same storage length as the MY when the seats are folded which is impressive.

Con's:

* Rear boot opening is... not very big. And without the seats folded the space isn't very big either. You would really struggle to get an MTB in there, even big luggage is an ask. 
* Also Keycard or Phone only.
* Same tech foibles as the MY - iPad can quickly become distracting if you try and interact with something like Spotify.

# Conclusion

I bought the MY LR - entirely because I liked that it could turn into a decent camper (I laid down in the boot of all the cars except the C40) and I wanted the extra battery for road trips - I hike, bike, and travel a fair bit. The MY also had the most practical amount of space out of the cars. I think the Volvo/P2 are nice but a P2 configured with the same stuff as a M3 is a 10-15k difference - same with the Volvo/MY, and after that I don't feel like you're necessarily getting a better car.

Maybe I'll do an update after it arrives and I've lived with it for a bit.

# BONUS: Build Quality (Volvo/Polestar vs. Tesla)

They're identical. Honestly, I wasn't 'blown away' by how much better made the Volvo/P2 were. In truth I didn't notice anything, and I did reef on the MY centre console to check for squeaks. Maybe I'm not that good at telling the difference, but I wouldn't consider the extra 10-ish k for an equivalent Polestar as buying you a 'better made' car - at least on first impression. Seems to come down to the fact that our Teslas in Aus are China-made. That might change when it comes to the mechanicals of them though, I didn't look there. ",Reddit
"At that price point, it undercuts the Model Y Long Range by around $7k before on-roads. And with 498km of WLTP range and standard dual motor AWD, the Polestar seems primed to pose serious competition.

"DO NOT go into this *expecting* profit from resale value.

EVs are a rapidly evolving technology, there is no denying that. As more and more improvements are made, EVs of today may not hold it's value at all in 3-5 years time.

With petrol/diesel cars they've truly run out of ""revolutionary"" ideas. Engines from most brands have been refined over and over, transmissions have been smoothed out, the technology on the inside and fresh interior/exterior designs is the only thing left attracting new buyers.

With EVs, there are still much more work to do especially in battery chemistry research.

This is one of the many reasons why I've chosen a shorter lease on a relatively cheap EV, the BYD Atto 3.

$250/week ($39K over 3 years) fully pretax. 

$28,000 residual. 

At least $15,000 (accounting for increase in salary over the years) in tax savings over 3 years.

Total cost = $47K

Car cost = $49K driveaway ($46K including QLD $3,000 rebate)",2023-04-06 06:11:48,"Novated Leasing for PHEVs and EVs (Polestar and Cupra discussed below)




Hi,

Currently in the market for a new car and have the option of a novated lease. Have typically turned all of these down but with the new laws removing FBT and GST among other things, novated leasing for EVs and PHEVs start to look very attractive vs purchasing through a car loan, or even, purchasing outright in some cases. But it all hinges on resale.

The main hitch at the moment is that balloon payment, which for both of the below cars sits at around 30k after 5 years (actual risidual is 20k but selling for a profit has been a feature of novated leases for a while). You do end up saving quite a bit of money if you can ensure a decent resale value after 3/5 year but given the small sample size for EVs around that age as well as the projections on battery life/replacements... is a decent resale value to be expected?

Two cars I'm looking at right now are the Polestar 2 EV (the 2024 model) (70k-75k) and the Cupra Formentor PHEV (60k-65k).

The Polestar is slightly more expensive while being a fully electric vehicle. While the Cupra, although cheaper, falls into the PHEV category.

Im torn as to whether the resale value of these cars in 5 years will tank the overall viability of the novated lease.

The post isn't directed at these two cars specifically (though the brands being relatively untried in Australia may add to the discussion) but more about the overall EV and PHEV market.

"GWM and Geely have had a couple of cracks at the Australian market, so they carry some stigma from their previous attempts.

LDV has often been a 'cheap' brand, it was the brand you went for if you wanted a cheap ute. 

BYD and MG are kinda the outliers, they've come out of nowhere with interestingly cheap cars. Yes I know MG *was* a British mark, but unless you've got a mate with a classic car it's just another brand. 

You say Polestar is just a Volvo reskinned. But it isn't to most people. Most people will walk past their show rooms in a big shopping centre, or go in and have a look around them, the interior design both of the cars and the show rooms themselves are unstated and not cheap. Most people probably don't even know it's connected to Volvo. 

And now getting down to it, a lot of the car buying general public don't care, price and availability that's what people are worrying about. 

(Some) Chinese cars are seen as what's on the cutting edge, and the cutting edge which is affordable. There's the statement I've seen that your phone is made in China and you don't worry about the quality of that, so why not a car?

So it's well known that this sub *generally* hates Chinese built cars.

BYD, LDV, MG, GWM, Chery, etc all get absolutely dragged for better or worse.

However, I recall that when Tesla moved manufacturing from Fremont to Shanghai, a lot of people seemed to think that the cost would drop (it did a little bit), however the fear was that, like any other Chinese manufactured car, it would depreciate at roughly the same speed as the space shuttle reentering the atmosphere.

However it seems that's not the case and people seem to prefer the Chinese built cars.

Same for Volvo, it seems that the XC40 and C40 are built in China and they seem to have similar depreciation, or even better depreciation numbers over EU built Volvo's.

Polestar, look at EU built Polestar models, and the values are pretty average.

Look at the new ones since Geely split them off as their own marque of Polestar instead of a Polestar Specced Volvo, and then started building them in China, the value of the brand seemed to increase.

I mean, the Polestar 2 is still just a C40 or XC40 with a couple different body panels and a slightly different interior trim. They're just pretending it's a different brand and car.

Then look at Lotus, people are frothing for the Eletre to start getting delivered.

Then jump across to Volkswagen, people love the T-Roc despite it being built by SAIC who also build MG and LDV.

I mean, it's easy to just be like ""People are Racist"", but if it was just plain recism, you'd think it would blanket all Chinese cars, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

I understand some are better built than others, and I'm not saying an MG ZS is the same build quality as a Volvo XC60.

"Its really rather simple.

Cars are products.

Products are designed and built by people.

The question you should ask yourself is what makes a Japanese car different from an American car? Well it comes to the people in charge of the product development lifecycle.

The Japanese people have their own distinctive philosophy and personality that they bring to the design process. This trickles down into how they manufacture. A lot of it is based on the market theyre designing for, which is usually focused on their domestic market first (as its the safest, and designers have the best insight into local problem-solutions).

So a Chinese car is the same. It comes down to the R&D department. If MG are designed by Chinese nationals in China then yeah its a Chinese car, but if its designed in Britain then I wouldnt say its Chinese.

The closest Chinese car products I can think of are:

- BYD
- Dongfeng
- Great Wall
- NIC

Although I dont know how with enough detail on how these cars are designed, since BYD apparently has had its interior designed by some folks from Mercedes

A simple example is go for a test drive in the Ford Mustang and then drive a Honda Civic Type R. The design philosophy is completely different so the end result feels different. Thats why there is no perfect car  buy something that connects with you and your lifestyle. Obviously taking into account price-value and all of that too.

I should add that nationality plays a role, but importantly its the leadership of the team that makes a car what it is as each car has to fill a unique product-niche category. So its likely that youll get a Chinese or a Japanese car that can feel pretty similar but uniquely different based on the underlying platform they use. A good example is the German car makers all have platforms that are designed for ride comfort when driving really fast  this makes sense for them as they have big sweeping autobahns. Therefore they feel similar to one another but are differentiated based on the engines and how they deliver power, the overall steering feel, rear wheel vs AWD and so on.",2024-01-08 02:11:24,"Where is the line between a vehicle being Chinese owned versus becoming a Chinese car?

2. act like a sole trader: you're the owner, this company is your responsibility now. You change things. you hire and fire. you get involved.

"The line that I think is the most practical and sensible to draw on for me is the majority owner, as that's where all of the main decisions are going to come from and are going to be the one that ultimately shape the brand. 

I'd say Stellantis is an exception to this because it's a result of multinational amalgamation and it's harder to define one particular country where all of their business decisions and influence come from. In regards to EU businesses it's even harder. 

But for the case of Chinese corporations like Geely, SAIC, Dongfeng. It's all clear cut. They're the one actively controlling their subsidiaries. They are the one pushing their platform and tech plus manufacturing base to the marque they owned. 

> As a hypothetical, if Geely were to buy Holden and start slapping lion badges on the MG3, would the folks insisting that MG is still British call it an Australian car? I'd argue it wouldn't be.

Completely glosed over the fact that Jaguar is also owned by ""the Indians""

But it's still generally believed that Jaguar, Land Rover, Volvo, etc are of their primary nation they were founded in.

But then you get some other brands, MG is very clearly a British car from when it started, but no one is off the confusion that they are still British and everyone's pretty much in agreement that they are now a Chinese company.

Same with LDV. They would definitely a British/Dutch partnership, No one's gonna say they're British or Dutch these days. They're definitely Chinese.

But in both cases, it's a similar situation where a Chinese company bought a European brand.

So what makes MG and LDV more Chinese than say Polestar which is developed and built in China on a Chinese platform by Chinese workers and Engineers?

I mean, MG still gets British designers involved, same as Polestar gets Swedish designers involved.

And then you have Tesla, One of the very first companies in China to not have any involvement with the Chinese government in building their factory and running it.

Ever since 2021, every single Tesla Model 3 and Tesla Model Y that has been sold in Australia has been a Chinese car. 

People like to say that they prefer the Chinese Teslas over the American Built Teslas and they built to a substantially better quality, which goes against the grain of people saying that cars built in China are going to be automatically worse because the skills and the factories are worse quality than American or European factories.

Turns out, the Chinese factory is better than the US factory, and the worker skills are better, leading to better quality.

Long timer reader first time poster! Hopefully a bit of an unconventional thread.. I have 20k to spend on a fun and unique car, something that has a bit of performance or luxury.. 

Few points to consider

- wont be my daily, therefore doesnt have to be economical

- although my budget for the car itself is 20k, I have plenty put aside in case something were to go horribly wrong

- regarding the point above, I dont want to spend 50k on a car as Im not sure how much use shell actually get used, therefore 20k is the car budget itself (or around there at least) with plenty aside for maintenance etc if required

- thinking no older than mid 90s

So far Im thinking something like:

* Porsche Cayenne (v8 first gen, possibly turbo?)
* Mercedes S500 (w140)
* Volvo S60 Polestar (prob would need to increase budget slightly to obtain one)
* Porsche Boxster - wouldnt be an S though
* Lexus LS**",Reddit

So it's worth waiting until at least the end of the year.",2023-03-26 22:46:18,"Owners groups made my decision on which EV to buy




So, in Australia we have fewer options than the rest of the world. Which is part of why I held off for so long.

For ages my option was basically the colour choice of my Tesla.

But now there's a lot more mature options, a bit more spread, a bit more infrastructure, and the fact that I'm driving a hell of a lot more to go to work and back, the fuel savings have finally tipped.

I wanted something that would either be useful, can use to tow a trailer to the tip (garbage dump, refuse centre, etc) occasionally.

Something that had a bit of punch (likely a dual motor)

Had 400km of range (I do 130km round trip to work daily, as I'm driving from where I live rural, into the city outskirts)

(Also of note, the average Australian drives only 36km per day, that's a single round trip of 18km, so I'm doing around 130km a day I'm doing more than 3.5x average kilometres)

Then I wanted to do some mods, simple ones:

1) Set of spotlights, because I already have a decent set that I paid good money for that can shoot around 800m/0.5 miles

2) Close enough tyre size to some decent all terrains, mild all terrains, but all terrains

3) Towbar

4) Sunroof would be nice

5) Good sized froot that wasn't an afterthought

6) Can fit a half decent pram in the boot if we do have kids

From there, it narrowed me down to probably 4 options:

1) Tesla Model 3 P - $98,875 AUD

2) Polestar 2 PPP (Plus, Pilot, Performance) - $104,967.05

3) Volvo C40 Recharge - $89,370

4) Volvo XC40 Recharge - $86,849

I had considered the Model Y, but the 2 things that turned me off were the very harsh ride of the suspension, and unlike the Model 3, you couldn't adjust the strength of the Regen.

The C40 and XC40 I am yet to test drive, as they are unobtainable to find one that someone will let you test drive.

But the biggest thing is the owners groups. Rated from best to worst.

##Polestar

Seriously, the best owners group. Few people were a bit ""wtf"", but they all were some form of ""car person"" and the Polestar is a car. It's an EV, but primarily, it's a car.

I want mud tyres? Go for it.

I want to lift it, use V60 Station Wagon parts (apparently)

I want spotlights? You need this CANBUS trigger to pull this message to activate the relay.

You want to mod it? Not our cup of tea, but go for it. We're both car enthusiasts and we can be enthusiastic in different ways.

The Polestar community was only 1 of 2 communities where I got unsolicited inboxes.

For the Polestar community I was shared a number of YouTube videos on people in Europe who modified their Polestars, and the Polestar ""Arctic Edition""

And a few people who were watching what I did so they can follow. I don't like being a guinea pig, but ok.

##Volvo

Question was always ""but why?"", there was one bloke who decided that he wanted to talk about Venn diagrams and such bizarrely.

But it had to have been the single most unhelpful community I have ever come across.

Zero knowledge of their cars, zero understanding of anything other than ""I get it in, it takes me where I want to go""

A few people that tried to argue that looking at it funny would cause all the warranty to fail (in Australia, warranty is only on affected parts, if you change your rims and the doors fall off, they have to put your doors back on, channel your rims and they damage the hub, then you have to pay for new hubs)

##Tesla

This is where I actually got ***hate***, I actually got abusive messages to my inbox that I wasn't ""the right person"" to own a Tesla.

People would say things like ""Fitting all terrain tyres will affect your range, don't you know that?"" I'd be like ""Yeah I know, but all terrain tyre's on a rural roads will get me significantly farther than flat road tyres"" which would just lead to insults.

Apparantly fitting spotlights will affect the radar that the cars don't have, and the ones that do have it, don't use? I didn't understand that argument, I thought Tesla's were vision only?

And the spotlights will reduce range.

And my personal favourite

""Driving that many kilometres will degrade your battery faster, so the battery won't be as good for the next person""

As if I've ever, ever, enjoyed my cars in a limited way so that the next person can....insert commentary on not having intimate relationships with your current partner so they are good for their next partner.....

It's as if resale, and keeping the car perfect is the point of ownership....at that point, you're not an owner, you're a caretaker or a custodian.

It was the inboxes that got me, the fact that because I wanted to have *my* car and do *my* thing, I wasn't a ""right fit for the community"", which in all my years of owning cars, I have *never* encountered with a car community is that kind of push back.

I've never had abusive inboxes before because I've asked for owners experiences and advice.

##Summary

I'm not saying that a car community is the *only reason* you buy a car, but it is a fun part of the ownership experience.

You can collectively enjoy a shared experience, and collectively share your knowledge and expertise.

It's fun going to owners meetups, and cars & coffee meets and finding your ""kin"", it's an additional layer of community in your life with some cars.

After all this, all 4 cars on my list ticked my personal boxes, be they practical, or aesthetically. Some cars I just simply hopped in them and just didn't like them.

So it came down to which has the better community, and for that the Polestar won.

I'm very big on it being that it's ok to like a car for personal reason, it's ok to not like a car, it's completely fine to have your things, and your car, it doesn't affect me, and as the younger crowd say (I hope I'm using this right) ""you do you, boo""

So in this case, my experience with the owners swayed my decision on what car I am getting.

I liked them all, on merit, they were all *to me and my desires*, comparable.

The Volvo I may have not liked the drive of (given that the 3 and Y are fairly similar, and I loved the 3 driving experience, hated the Y driving experience), though given they are fairly similar architecturally to the Polestar 2, I would hope they'd be similar.

It was the feedback from owners I wanted, and it was feedback I got (and from 1 group, am still getting, thankyou Polestar owners)

And it was that feedback that Ultimately swayed my decision.

Have others been swayed by the community? Or was this a silly thing to be the deciding vote for me?",Reddit

The supercharging network is the best right now and will probably be the future of EV charging.

Also had a Polestar 2 for a weekend. Looks cool but its boring to drive to be honest. Theres a setting in it which makes feel like its in gear but it feels fake. Balance of the car is also different to a regular car so felt weird around a corner. I got bored of it really fast. 

A4 B9s are really good. Car just feels strong. Materials in the car are nice to touch - alcantara, perforated leather steering wheel, nappa leather seats. Quattro system feels super safe and confident in the wet. Weve had ours for a few years. No major issues so far. Slightly slower than a Cupra but still fast enough.

I just don't want to be too floaty when I drive, I have no intentions to track it - but I just like that my golf doesn't float through corners and it always feels relatively tight. I want to avoid big size hogs like Toyota Klugers or Jeeps. I don't do a lot of highway driving, so will mostly be confined to 99% City driving.

Budget can go up to 100k but ideally below that would be better. I want to stay away from Chinese made cars. So no BYD, MG, Chery, Great Wall - not unless someone has a really good experience with them. I just don't feel they've been long enough on the road to iron out the kinks. The price also scares me on providing something like that.

I've considered things like Ioniq 5, Ioniq 6, Polestar 2 for EVs. I'm open to things like an A4, Passat or any other ICE. But ideally, should be going for an EV at this point in time. Please let me know your thoughts. We plan on making a purchase potentially mid to late next year. Just want to see what's on the market now/on the horizon.

"It's really that big, it was designed as a 7 seater so it's super long  and then has a massive sub boot. It also has a reasonably big frunk. There's no trickery, it's just that EVs, and Teslas in particular, make great use of internal space. The rear leg room in the Model Y, for example, is ridiculous for a car it's size. The Model X, despite being smaller than a Landcruiser, had way more room in the 3rd row of seats, despite a sloping roof line. You could actually fit adults back there, which is unheard of in anything short of a minivan.",2023-05-16 00:40:38,"Model Y boot space?




Im looking at for an EV with enough space for my young family, so naturally boot space is a key criteria. I really dont want a Tesla Model Y but its boot space is 971L. 

Compare that with:
Atto 3 = 440L
Ioniq 5 = 527L
EV6 = 490L
Polestar 4 = ~500L
Hell, even the Landcruiser = 742L

My question is: is the Model Ys boot space really that big? Is it practical? What sort of black magic is used to have all that space in a small/medium SUV?

Is it really all useable or is this some Elon marketing baloney?

"GWM Tank 300 is great. Fully fledged off roader for $50k with a nicer interior and features than anything remotely off road for that price. 7 year unlimited KM warranty and 5 year roadside assistance. It won't tow as much as a Japanese equivalent 4x4 but again for the money it's great value.

Windows are double glazed too which means the cabin is super quiet and the 2l turbo seems to do the job just fine. I reckon with a tune up it would be a really great engine.

Some car reviewers have noted that on a 100-0km emergency brake test the back wheels leave the ground slightly for a fraction of a second, but honestly when you have stuff in the boot or rear passengers this does not happen and can be mitigated with stiffer rear suspension. I believe GWM have been made aware of this and are issuing a fix.

Very moddable car as well as it's been on the Chinese market for almost 4 years now so there's a ton of mods available. Seems reliable too but obviously need more than 4 years to really tell.

"Between myself, family members and friends, we own 5 BYD Atto 3s.

Many commenters here tend to bundle BYD with Made In China trash like other brands such as MG/LDV etc. which is understandable but far from the truth.

Off sales alone, BYD is the **top selling** EV/hybrid brand across the world.

BYD's history is definitely shorter than the competition, but since 2003 they have come a very long way.

The BYD E6 is a very popular model used by taxi drivers in China. Data shows on average, after approximately 300,000 KMs, the high voltage battery capacity only degraded by 5%.

I have a very distant relative that has pushed their E6 to 500,000 KMs, with battery degradation at 7%. They are a career taxi driver, and believed this will be the last taxi car they own, until retirement.

In recent years, BYD has also invested a lot of money in not just making good cars, but making EVs. Their recent introduction of about a dozen different BEV/PHEVs has resulted in massive uptake by the Chinese domestic market. 

In even more recent times, they've decided to expand their reach to international markets, hence the decision to make this post, I imagine.

I can understand the hesitation given most motorists would have no context on what BYD is and how their cars are, but for those that know, BYD make great cars.

For my personal Atto 3, it's quieter, smoother and higher quality material/assembly than the Model Y that I drove. There is no rattles, no squeaks, no panels gaps, nothing. Of course this can vary vehicle to vehicle. Not to mention I also get to save an extra $20,000.

If you're tech savvy, you'll be keen to learn that the media screen runs a locked down version of Android 10. No Google Play Services as we all know why, but sideloading, running sandboxed applications and even rooting the device is all achievable. It is indeed a very interesting system. The safety systems of the car are isolated within another OS that is not user accessible, so don't worry.

Now, the car isn't perfect of course. Comparing this to a ~$73K Model Y, the speakers are noticeably worse, the performance is worse, the efficiency is slightly less, and it's also a bit buggy given the media screen runs modified Android 10. Though the latter point has mostly been rectified after recent OTA updates. But if you are able to overlook this and save $20,000, I think you would have found a winner.

For anyone looking to buy but are not desperate, I would highly recommend waiting till at least the end of this year. Your more well known brands such as Renault, Nissan, VW, Toyota and Subaru etc. will be introducing various models of EVs to our market.

If you can read Chinese, or are bothered enough to translate, a Chinese car review publication recently published an article where they tear apart the entire car (literally) and discuss every aspect of the car: https://www.pcauto.com.cn/tech/3247/32471215.html

The conclusion was: ""After tearing this (Atto 3 / Yuan Plus) apart, we can see the level of achievement by BYD. Not only is the car good looking, it is full of features, environmentally friendly materials, tons of sound deadening material, a highly sophisticated software and hardware system and a very impressive vehicle and battery structure. Through the independent research, development and innovation, the Yuan Plus (Atto 3) has demonstrated a very strong and competitive offering among it's competitors. We believe it will stand out among the new energy (EV) market.""",2023-02-12 00:34:54,"thoughts on BYD electric cars?

"The marketing is working full steam ahead to sell them (Europe, CZ). Practically nobody buys them here. 

I did a test drive with the ATTO3  and I have to say I was fairly unimpressed:

The interior has a giant screen in the middle like someone broke in a Tesla, stole the screen and slapped it in the middle of the board of the ATTO.

I'm 1m92 tall and I felt pretty crammed in the seat too, which are uncomfortable.

The infotainment is a tad bit slow but it's not an issue for me.

Weird gearbox taking up space in the middle, feels like I'm going back to the 2000s

Struggles quite a bit on uphill roads, which I found to be worrying.

"I pre-order mine in early August 2022 and took delivery in early December. 

There are some minor bugs that hopefully can be addressed by software updates, such as;
* the navigation software keeps defaulting to no highway/freeway routes, even though it was unselected in the settings (this started since the recent 2 updates).
* the navigation system lost its GPS coordinates, had to pull over, power the car down and back on and it has been fine since.
* cruise control wouldnt set, as above had to pull over and power cycle the car. It has been working fine since.

* heat pump - this issue is I believe only an isolated problem and just being my bad luck. The heat pump does have a leak from the day I picked up the car. Been back to repair twice already, the 2nd time they kept it for 4 or 5 days and it had worked well since the end of Feb. Over the past few days It now has gradually not cooled down as well as it has been. Its is going back to Coffee Ford on Tuesday

But for me the best thing is that I no longer have to concern about the fuel price or needing to queue at the service station. One of the main reasons I got the Atto 3 over Tesla 3/Y is due to the BYD LFP blade battery.

"Happy to meet up in real life mate.

What makes you say reliability is mild at best? I'd love a source on that. BYD has sold millions of EVs. In the home market of China, they outsell Tesla, but I'm sure you already knew that. Personally I know a few people who own BYD E6 as taxi drivers. They've nothing to complain about. But, as it is anecdotal evidence, I tend to not mention it because I prefer to look at what the media reports on, as evidence.

Interior is cheap plastic? Well of course it is! It's one of the cheapest EV's on the market! Were you expecting genuine leather or something? Once again, even a $60K Tesla doesn't give you real leather.

My particular Atto 3 is fitted together very well. It has no rattles, panel gaps are fair, I have nothing to complain about, but with every mass produced car, there are always one or two cars here and there that left quality control's hands when it shouldn't have - no car is immune to this fact.

What makes you think BYD is tricking people into buying their cars? I'm genuinely curious because whenever any car is discussed - EV or BYD or not, there's always one person in the comments that like to pull out the conspiracy card - yet none I've seen can back up their claims.

So far, having joined virtually every Australian BYD group on Facebook, I have not seen above-average levels of fit and finish complaints.

Once again, I'm happy to have a sit down, face-to-face chat if you're up for it mate. A video call is good too if that's what you prefer. Always happy to discuss technology with untrusting folk. I do enjoy an intellectual discussion on rapidly evolving technologies like electric vehicles.

P.S. I'm a recent Uni graduate working in the field of IT. BYD's multimedia system is one of the best as it runs open source Android, it is something I am really passionate about having studied user experience and design philosophy. No multimedia system comes close to this level of customisation.",2023-09-21 08:21:18,"thoughts on BYD electric cars?

Google can help you with just how shit of a job they have done in selling BYD here. Not that BYD sells bad, but they'd sell a whole lot better with a Tesla-esque direct to customer sales model. Through multiple cock ups, promised features (wireless CarPlay was promised Q4 2022, we are nearly Q4 2023!) and ANCAP nonsense, it has been far from smooth.

With that said, I'll be keeping this after my novated lease ends. It has enough features for us to keep it until it is mechanically/economically unviable to continue using.

Keep in mind the Seal U, despite it's naming similarity to the Seal, is a COMPLETELY different vehicle. For starters they are **not on the same platform**. Seal is on a dedicated EV platform. Seal U (BYD Song Plus) is built off an older, petrol/hybrid first platform. This means interior packaging efficiency (relatively small boot and no frunk) and energy consumption (kWh/100KM) will be worse than other cars of it's class, that have been built on dedicated EV platform.",2023-09-16 23:46:30,"thoughts on BYD electric cars?

"Tesla Model 3 owner here too. Also definitely not a Tesla fanatic. When I replace mine I expect it to be another brand. That said given the state of the market today the 3 and Y are probably still the best overall picks. 

The Teslas as thing stand today just have a very compelling price:value proposition and are very easy to live with. 

The Polestar 2 is good and on the outside I think it looks significantly more premium than the Tesla however I personally find the interior a bit cheap and plasticy even with the interior upgrade option. Headroom in the back is poor. Luggage space is pretty limited compared to the Tesla. 

The Mercedes and BMW options arent bad but either arent on dedicated EV platforms and so are a bit compromised on weight and therefore range and performance, as well as cargo capacity, or where they are on EV specific platforms they struggle to compete with the value proposition of the Teslas. 

In a year or two there will be such a dramatic improvement in available semi-premium EVs youll be spoiled for choice. The upcoming Genesis crossover looks especially appealing but really theres going to be a bonanza of cars across the $70-100k range from all established brands.

">Personally if I went EV, Id avoid Tesla as their build quality is rubbish. However they are also the only EV manufacturer actually delivering in real numbers.

Not a huge sample size but we have 3 Tesla's (well, 2 now but we have owned 3 in total) and all 3 have been absolutely perfect. No panel gaps, great paint, no rattles in interior etc - not a single mechanical problem or glitch at all, owned for 3 years. We also know a few people who have them and same thing there, zero problems.

My long range M3 I sold with 100,000 km's was still driving perfectly when I sold it.

I've read the stories online about build quality as well and I can't help but think it's that old thing of the people who are unhappy making noise, and the much greater percentage of people who are happy not saying anything. With Tesla's there's also another group who have never owned or touched the cars who constantly say how shit they are as well.",2023-01-22 21:09:39,"Non Tesla EV experiences?

The MG ZS is $23,990 drive-away.I have been looking to purchase a used: Corolla, Camry, Civic, Accord, Rav4, CRV, Mazda-3, Mazda-6, Lexus IS. At the same price point, you can get these models with 50,000-100,000kms that look to be well maintained, ranging from 2012-2018 models usually. But, in my head I just can't get over the fact that you could buy a brand new SUV for the same price.

In my mind, the strongest arguments against buying a new MG ZS would be:

* They don't last as long as well made japanese cars
* You will incur more costs because things go wrong with them more frequently
* You will lose money at re-sell because people don't want to buy second hand models

However, you are buying a car that's new, so it's 5-10 years younger than the comparative used Japanese cars. You're also getting 7 year warranty, whether you think that's negligible or not.

Are these the right arguments for and against? I just want to make sure I understand the for and against sides. I also don't really understand the magnitude of each argument. For example, maybe these new cars really do just break very quickly, and I'm not weighting that appropriately.

"I'm not going to discuss MG ZS in particular, because I have little knowledge of MG. When it comes to performance, one of the huge things on cars I found worth noting is the automatic transmission. When it comes to transmissions and especially automatic transmissions, I only have trust in particular car brands such as Toyota and Honda. Long-time automatic transmission remains a difficult task to this date, and this applies to even the latest new 2019-2023 cars. If you read the reports and reviews, you'd see a lot of premature automatic transmission failures and issues. These include jerking upon shifting, delayed gear selection, as well as failure to switch into a gear. Other huge matters are steering feedback, safety feature effectiveness, airbags performance, decent electrical system... Surprisingly, some or many 2023 cars do not even perform as well as 2012-2022 cars of the same segment. Newer does not always mean better.

I'd recommend Honda HRV, Toyota Corolla Cross, Toyota RAV4 and Mitsubishi ASX for cars of similar segment.

"I think going forward with Chinese EVs, you have little choice but to put up with the software they are using... these cars are all heavily s/w controlled.

But obviously if its an MG fucken MG3 which is a decade old hatch, this is not an issue.

I've driven a few Havals and those have a lot of software in them but less so than an EV... but the big touchscreen exists on all of them.

Also you see here how the fish rots from the top... these Chinese companies are mixing with the worst of Australian importers and local support and you get them gaslighting customers... eg, LDV saying customer cars can rust.... when the dealer is one street away from the beach!

White australians running defence for chinese companies would be a big no from me.

I also think realistically I see so many ""normies"" ie. middle eastern, sub continent folks etc. who seem to buy these things and they have no issue... I see SO MANY LDV and Haval GWM utes so they must be doing something reasonable there.

This place may not be the best place to ask but in the real world many people only want to spend sub $40k on a ute... and that means Chinese? so do I laugh at them and deride them like so many here do as if to say... ""oh you so poor, why didnt you buy a $70k Hilux SR5?""

"Couple of thoughts:

Your insurance quote for the Model Y at the bottom of the table seems to be too low.

Check the real world range for the EV when estimating their running cost, and whether you plan on putting in solar to make them cheaper. 

Finally, have a look at the Polestar 2 and the Model 3 in person, as I found their rear seats to be quite cramped. I'm 184cm, and I found the rear seats to be cramped if I'm sitting behind my own driving position. The Polestar and Volvo EVs are also based on an ICE vehicle platform, so they have a transmission hump in the rear footwell, despite not needing it to house the driveshaft and exhaust pipes.

If you are keen on an EV, I'd add the Hyundai ioniq 5 and Kia EV6 to the list.",2023-02-21 09:55:18,"Looking at a new car, any that I should knock out of consideration?

All the rest are budget direct off compare the market.

>Check the real world range for the EV when estimating their running cost, and whether you plan on putting in solar to make them cheaper. 

Yes, used ADR81/02 ranges for both EV and ICE ranges, so it was consistent.

I already have solar, it would be sunk cost fallacy to put it in *just* for an EV.

There was definitely an issue with early Model 3s, during the early production ramp up. My 2020 example was okay but not great, but most people I met at chargers had build issues

That's pretty much entirely resolved now though - my 2023 Model Y is as well built as the Audi/BMW vehicles I've owned (I'm not saying it's a Rolls Royce, but it's decent). The interior materials aren't quite as good (but neither are the Polestar's), but the build quality issues seem solved

But this subreddit has a hard on for ""Tesla Bad"" sometimes and it gets a bit silly - this being a great example because when you look at the prices the Polestar is really shitty value

I meant what I said when I said I wanted the Polestar and expected to buy one - I almost ordered one without even test driving it as I loved the idea. Then we decided to be sensible and took a 48 hour extended test drive ... and realised it's less range for more money even for the base model

And then you're paying on top of that for features that are standard with Tesla - including safety features and things that I'd consider pretty basic in a ""premium"" EV (adaptive cruise control, heat pump heating, heated wheel). To get a Polestar 2 to the same basic spec as a Standard Range Model 3 is about 9k more even without going crazy with options

That energy balance doesn't shift much if you change the source (aka synthetic fuels).

The difference is we have the opportunity to power EVs from green sources. You don't get that with ICE. As I said before, you don't have a greener possibility for fuels because of the lower efficiency and increased energy cost.

Recycling is possible for batteries. We see second life for EV batteries in stationary applications

Reliable, fast within incredible fuel economy for its weight, 5.9l on 100km by going 160 or 180, because really good aerodynamics, real spare on board and more airbags than I could count. I think there is no other car in existence, produced or sold today, which would have a better fuel economy for its weight of more than 1.6 t. Incredibly nice motorway tool for long range drives. Once followed the truck lane for 150km on the right side with 80km/h for 2.5l on 100km fuel economy. Had to sell it because of environmental laws. Modern Diesels use more Diesel.

">Aftercare at Tesla has been better than any other car I've ever owned.

Its probably great while its still under warranty and if you live near a tesla garage but expensive repairs that can only be carried out at tesla with very few repair centres in the UK. Lack of 3rd party support. Unlike other cars (including EVs) you cant just nip down to your local garage to get it repaired.

>Interior is far better than an equivalent Korean or Ford / Vauxhall car.

You are comparing apples and oranges. Yes the Korean brands have improved lately but they are still essentially budget brands. Tesla is a luxury brand and you are comparing it to fiestas, corsas and cee'ds 

>BMW, Mercedes and Audi - which are legacy manufacturers with far more experience building luxury cars. Unsurprisingly, they don't stack up against these.

Why is it unsurprising. Teslas are premium brand cars with a premium price tag. Id expect better than a plasticy interior with a giant ipad in the centre console full of gimmicky features.

>As for a James Bond villain? I don't get why people have such a big chip on their shoulder over Tesla. 

Because the man is one of the riches men in the world with a networth larger than some countries GDPs and hes a petulant immature man child. Who builds cars with silly gimmicks for other petulant man children.


>the car-buying public are voting with their feet and applying common sense, making it one of the most popular cars on sale

I actually feel pity for lots of the people who have a chip on both shoulders over what other people drive. It doesn't affect you directly so why are people so vocal about it?

So first person to say the car wins 5.  One guess each. Has to be the exact make and model. 

Good luck

High driving position so the front of the car can be seen so more reassuring for many/some drivers when driving slowly in car parks, at tight corners, etc.

"OK here goes:

First my requirements are for a supermini. Although I was tempted by a bigger car ultimately I don't need it so might as well save the money. That said I did want one that was on the more practical end of the spectrum.

Secondly I had a diesel Kia Ceed for a long time and my goodness what a cheap car to run it was. Other than usual wear and tear (battery, brakes, tires) the only things that went wrong were a valve in the turbo (20 part plus labour) and the front sway bar partly broke off after about 75k miles. Again less than 100 to sort. Near the end of its life the emissions started to become an issue but that's probably my fault for doing too many short trips on a diesel. Basically after that experience I was keen to get another Kia.

Thirdly it does all the things I need really well: It's as frugal (or more) as my old diesel but it's a petrol so that's less NOx in my city and shouldn't complain in the long term with short trips. The only ""upgrades"" i really wanted over my old car were Cruise Control and Daytime Running Lights but wireless Android Auto and Lane Centering were a great find.

What other cars did I consider? Well the Kia Ceed of course, but I didn't need a car that size. The Toyota Yaris Hybrid, but it wasn't practical enough and the interior was meh. The Corolla Hybrid, the most expensive option on my list. Finally the Ford Fiesta or the VW Polo and stablemates. I think those would have been great options but the experience with Kia and the long warranty tipped it in favour of the Rio.",2024-01-27 09:10:03,"Objectively, whats the best car a person can buy right now?

Hi all,

I recently finished the lease on my car and am looking to trade it in to something a bit more fun and sporty. I've recently changed jobs and use the train for commuting now, so this wouldn't really be my daily driver, I'll probably pick up something cheap and cheerful to do my local run around in.

I've never really had anything powerful so I am somewhat clueless in this department.

"I was looking at the same decision last year before I purchased my 440i Gran Coupe (similar budget). There was a 90% chance it was gonna be a BMW but I didnt want to be ignorant to the other options.

S5 17 - This car almost had me, tons of power from the V6, excellent interior, and the digital cluster is absolutely incredible. Soulless drive, doesnt feel sporty, really designed to be a cruiser I felt. It lost me on the test drive. 

Giulia Veloce 18 - Not a V6, but has a lot of presence with decent power behind it. Driving is sharp and very enjoyable. Interior is very nice too, seating position is solid. If you arent fussed about cylinders this car is truly remarkable. Alfa reliability should be considered though. 

C43 18 - Classic Mercedes IMO, very well balanced in terms of sharpness, power and comfort. It lost me on the interior - lots of plastic and the infotainment looked really dated. 

Maserati Id consider if you never plan on selling it - depreciates like crazy.

"The M5 (and M6) has an engine infamous for some very serious mechanical failures, you'll find a lot of them with engines replaced still under warranty and if you get a used one and the engine goes bang a reconditioned one goes for about 10 grand (that's without labour). M3/M4 is a more sensible choice although somewhat mundane by comparison.

Kia Stinger is also a solid car. They're quite big compared to your M3s and C63s I think.

The Audi S4/S5s look and sound nice and go reasonably well but they're really not as exciting to drive as the ones above.

C63 is always a solid choice if you want something with a real powerhouse of an engine, bit they're a bit overpriced compared to the competition, you pay a premium for it and it'll likely be the most expensive run of the list.

The Maserati is more of a luxury car compared to the others. Also the bravest choice in terms of reliability.

I'd pick the C63 but in coupe form, the saloon never looked right for me. If you must have rear doors I'd go for the M3 or Stinger.",2023-09-22 07:29:15,"High end saloon for around 25k?

"Mine's been great tbh. Only issue I've had since I bought in 2018 is the coolant hose broke from it's clip and chafed against the belt. Part was straight from JLR for 94 and that's it so far.

Hi all,

I recently finished the lease on my car and am looking to trade it in to something a bit more fun and sporty. I've recently changed jobs and use the train for commuting now, so this wouldn't really be my daily driver, I'll probably pick up something cheap and cheerful to do my local run around in.

I've never really had anything powerful so I am somewhat clueless in this department.

I've got a budget of roughly around 25k, wishful thinking I don't want a complete money pit, but am fully aware that maintenance costs are gonna be a bit pricey. This is dependent on my next job rate as I work somewhat freelance, so I'm only going down this road if I can financially justify it.

I've been looking at:

BMW M5/M4

Audi S5/S7

Merc C63 

Kia GT Stinger

Maserati Ghibli

As you can see from my choices, I'm not that fussed about the badge, so anything outside this list I will also consider. I would just like something that has some oomph, sounds great, nice curb appeal and has relatively decent gubbins, don't need something ultra modern and high tech, but at least a few quality of life features.

"Ignore the shit talking, the MG4 is being very well recieved by reviewers and owners alike. The 64kWh SE offers the best value, the Trophy adds slightly more aggressive styling and a few more toys, most importantly being heated seats and steering wheel.

The BYD is also being very highly reviewed, the interior and exterior styling is somewhat marmite but in the more subtle, sensible colours they look (imho) fine. As mentioned elsewhere here there are not a huge amount of BYD dealers at the moment but as one of the largest EV makers in the world and as an ambitious Chinese brand that is aggressively entering western markets I'm expecting to see many more BYD's on the road in coming years.

You mention a family, the MG's boot is 10ish litres larger but dimensionwise there seems to be very little in it.

Of the MG4 SE Long range and the BYD Dolphin Comfort I'd happily take either but I'm leaning towards the BYD because it's going to have a better tech level and a bit more perfomance (Greater Torque).

Above all make sure you test drive both!",2024-02-10 02:20:58,"Wait 6 months for an MG4 or 2 months for a BYD Dolphin?




I am looking at a low cost EV through the leasing scheme at work, both the MG4 and the BYD Dolphin seem like pretty decent value for money, with generally ok reviews. At the low end of the EV market I know, but I drive less than 5k a year, city driving mostly with a few longer drives with the family thrown in through the year. 
I'll be replacing a 20year old civic, which the garage has told me is unlikely to pass it's next MOT in October due to corrosion. 
Here's where the decision comes in. 
Difference in cost between the 2 cars is pretty negligible. 
However the MG is on a 6 month lead time and the BYD on 2 months.
I'm leaning towards waiting for the MG but also realise the longer I leave it the less valuable and more difficult it will be to get anything for the civic.

EVs are not going out of fashion. If they suit your driving distance and you have a driveway for charging they make perfect sense. For 35k you could get a used BMW iX3, basically an electric X3.

Hi All,

I am thinking about buying an older Defender and converting it to an electric. I have some questions which I hope you can help with.

**Here are the specs I am looking at:**

* I am looking at a pre-2016 (ignore 2001 in the post title) TD5 Defender 110 SUV (5-door).
* The donor car from my [searches on AutoTrader **costs around 20K**](https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-search?advertising-location=at_cars&include-delivery-option=on&make=Land%20Rover&model=Defender%20110&postcode=SW18%201hs&price-to=25000&quantity-of-doors=5&sort=year-dsc&year-from=2000&year-to=2015)**.**
* The electric conversion comes in a few options. I could choose between:
   * HYPER9HV, 120hp, 7X Tesla battery modules with 85-95 miles range and 5.5 hours regular charge. This will use the existing gear and transfer box. **The cost will be around 33K+VAT**.
   * Tesla Model 3 motor, 282 hp, 8x LG Chem modules (VW) with 120-140 miles range and 45 fast charge. This will power the differentials directly. **The cost will be around 44K+VAT.**
* The range is not a huge issue for me. Other than the occasional school drop-offs, it'll be used mostly during weekends driving to parks, visiting friends in London, etc.

**Now for the questions:**

* At the very lower end of the above, I could buy a brand-new Tesla Y/3, VW iD3, BMW i4, Polestar etc.  At the higher end of the above spec, I could even purchase a Taycan. I understand it's not a great decision with purely just a financial lens. But, comparatively, am I getting a lot less for the same cost?
   * I know I like the defender a lot more than all of these except maybe the Taycan makes me think through a few times.
* I live in Zone 2 in London and don't have my own parking space, though there is permitted street parking in front of the house. Is this a sure-shot car theft that will happen? Again, is this a horrible idea to buy this thing and park it on the street?
* The donor defenders come with high mileage. though the motor, etc. will be of course brand new. I will spend around 5-10K for a few maintenance upgrades (ball bearings, brakes, etc.) Is there a lot of maintenance I should expect beyond that?
* My original budget was 60K all-in. The Tesla motor would of course tear through this, but I feel if I am going through with this, it might be the route to go. Any thoughts on this?
* Getting some insurance quotes now, what should I watch out for?

Thanks in advance!",Reddit

My company's car scheme is fairly decent albeit based on a limited sample size. 

I get a 600 car allowance per month. If I opt for a 4 year lease of an electric vehicle I lose this allowance. There are many offerings, typically with a list price of 50-60k. Not quite the lows of early 2021 but prices are getting better. Electricity on the Shell public charging network is free and home charging + non-network charging can be expensed but I'll have to pay tax on it as a benefit-in-kind. 

The company allows an overspend of 150 from net pay to get better models than usually covered.

General car requirements: 

* I haven't had a car for a few years but I'm tired of trains and want more freedom. 
* Need space for camping gear and bicycles inside preferably 
* Ideally a fairly long range car to avoid spending too much time charging.
* Relatively ""fun"". I had a hot hatch before and I'd rather not get a slower EV.

When I look at the options I'm struggling to say no to the Model Y Long Range. It has acceptable range, relatively fun speed-wise, very practical and likely relatively good lead times. However, it's yet another Tesla and it doesn't look particularly great.

Financially it would cost 228 (net loss of car allowance), 54.60 BIK (based on 52850 list price) and 110 ""overspend"" from net pay. Total: 391/month for 4 years (unless I leave).

I could make minor changes to the config, such as change the colour for an extra 20/month. Unsure if that's worth it. 

I've considered the following other options: 

* Stay without a car, continue to lament trains etc.
* Polestar 2 Dual Motor Long Range - Fairly fun and practical but bit smaller and 24+ week lead times. 
* BMW i4 - I bet this is a fun car but currently missing from our scheme options and I imagine it's unlikely to get price competitive with Tesla for the tech included. Active Cruise Control isn't even included! 
* Kia EV6 - Looks a bit on the small side and not checked into the options too much but I imagine hard to meet Tesla kit.

I get a 600 car allowance per month. If I opt for a 4 year lease of an electric vehicle I lose this allowance. There are many offerings, typically with a list price of 50-60k. Not quite the lows of early 2021 but prices are getting better. Electricity on the Shell public charging network is free and home charging + non-network charging can be expensed but I'll have to pay tax on it as a benefit-in-kind. 

The company allows an overspend of 150 from net pay to get better models than usually covered.

General car requirements: 

* I haven't had a car for a few years but I'm tired of trains and want more freedom. 
* Need space for camping gear and bicycles inside preferably 
* Ideally a fairly long range car to avoid spending too much time charging.
* Relatively ""fun"". I had a hot hatch before and I'd rather not get a slower EV.

When I look at the options I'm struggling to say no to the Model Y Long Range. It has acceptable range, relatively fun speed-wise, very practical and likely relatively good lead times. However, it's yet another Tesla and it doesn't look particularly great.

Financially it would cost 228 (net loss of car allowance), 54.60 BIK (based on 52850 list price) and 110 ""overspend"" from net pay. Total: 391/month for 4 years (unless I leave).

I could make minor changes to the config, such as change the colour for an extra 20/month. Unsure if that's worth it. 

I've considered the following other options: 

* Stay without a car, continue to lament trains etc.
* Polestar 2 Dual Motor Long Range - Fairly fun and practical but bit smaller and 24+ week lead times. 
* BMW i4 - I bet this is a fun car but currently missing from our scheme options and I imagine it's unlikely to get price competitive with Tesla for the tech included. Active Cruise Control isn't even included! 
* Kia EV6 - Looks a bit on the small side and not checked into the options too much but I imagine hard to meet Tesla kit.

"I bought a model 3 for 25k from Tesla, its pretty good tbh and for my use (driveway with cheap home charging, drive 12000 miles a year) its very economical and when you look at total cost of ownership its competing with a small engined second hand golf or Octavia. A petrol car with equivalent performance (5 second 0-60) would cost me much more  per year.

I live walking distance to a Tesla centre which is lucky and have had something fixed there under warranty which might be a pain if your nearest is hours away.

Ive got 5 years battery warranty left, Ill decide whether to keep it or sell it in 4 years depending on price, price of potential replacement battery, reports of long term reliability etc etc but Im not especially worried about it because lots of people have put mega miles on theirs already and failure seems rare.

Ive heard the Kia ev6 and Hyundai equivalent are nice cars, nicer interior than Tesla but worse charging network and software. 

Petrol wise I think a bmw 320d or something like that would be the same size practicality and total cost of ownership but would be slower. Maybe an Octavia VRS or golf GTI would be in budget if you want more performance",2023-09-24 08:24:00,"Seeking Used car Alternatives to the Tesla Model 3  Need Advice!




Ive been mulling over the decision to get a used Tesla Model 3 around the 25k budget mark. Absolutely loved the experience after taking a test drive, but before I take the plunge, I wanted to see if there are any worthy alternatives out there, petrol or EV.

Tesla Model 3 Pros:

	1.	Supercharger Network: Teslas vast charging infrastructure.
	2.	Autopilot: Advanced self-driving capabilities.
	3.	Range: Stellar battery range, even more so for the long-range models.
	4.	Tech Innovations: The central touchscreen, over-the-air updates, and more.
	5.	Performance: Robust acceleration and a thrilling drive.

Tesla Model 3 Cons:

	1.	Price: Even second-hand, they can command a premium.
	2.	Build Quality: Some owners of older models report build quality concerns.
	3.	Service Challenges: Fewer service centres in comparison to established brands.
	4.	Interior Design: The ultra-minimalist interior may not be to everyones liking.
	5.	Battery Health: Unsure about the longevity of the battery in older models.

With tech features, especially autonomous driving capabilities, being at the forefront of my decision, Id love to hear recommendations for other used EVs or petrol vehicles available in the UK around 25k budget. Ideally, these would come close or even surpass the tech features and self-driving aspects of the Model 3.

Hugely appreciate any pointers you all might have!

Thanks in advance for the suggestions!",Reddit

Full disclosure: Im a Tesla guy, with an old MS @160k miles and a 22 MYP.

I reserved a full size car from Hertz for a trip I am currently on. When I checked in they did not have any standard full size cars but offered me a Polestar instead for the same price. I asked about the charging situation and was told there are plenty so I agreed. The car was charged to 98% which made me take a mental note to never buy a prior rental EV. At first I hated the driving dynamics because regen braking was off. Once I figured that out it was actually a great drive, with strong regen braking all the way to a stop. Acceleration was snappy and similar to my S85 but much slower than the MYP. 

Negatives compared to Tesla: I know this will be controversial but the interior was just okay. There is a circular knob in front of the shifter for controlling volume. Why wasnt this put on the steering wheel instead?? Too many buttons. Ive spent the past 6 years with the minimalist interior of the S and everything has worked great. There are also way too many buttons on the steering wheel and you usually have to look at it to figure out which one to press. Speaking of the shifter, that also could have been on a steering wheel stalk and saved a lot of space. Charging was a pain. There were Tesla superchargers near me but I couldnt use those. I had to use PlugShare to find the fastest chargers that were close by, and those happened to be 40kW stations. I had to download an app and load money onto it for that to work. These charged me a per hour rate as Im currently visiting Canada and that must be a thing here. I did not want to spend extra time charging so I am going to pay the $35CAD fee for returning an under-charged car. I realize this problem will probably go away when the Tesla charging standard kicks in. Trunk space was much smaller than the MS and was almost completely full with 2 checked suitcases. Frunk is essentially useless except for holding the charging cable.

BIGGEST NEGATIVE: driver assistance left much to desire. The lane assist kept bouncing me side to side in the lane and required me to apply force every 10 seconds or so or it would start beeping annoyingly. Adaptive cruise was okay but kept too much distance even at the smallest following setting.

Positives about the Polestar: range was quite good and the estimate was fairly accurate. Styling is pretty good although I couldnt tell if it wanted to be a small SUV or sedan. CarPlay was very nice although it required the phone to be plugged in. Birds eye parking view and rear cross traffic alert were nice to have.

Overall: I thought I might consider buying a Polestar if a great deal for a used one came up before trying out their driver assistance features.

"I think the Volvo/ polestar Pilot assist is miles better than the Tesla autopilot. I have owned 3 Volvos with Pilot Assist and had a rental Polestar for a week recently too. I currently own a base Tesla M3.

I assume the OP may have not switched over to pilot assist from the Adaptive Cruise option, as its not obvious how to without knowledge/ instruction. 

I have never experienced any bouncing side to side with the 3 Volvos or the Polestar on pilot assist.


Otherwise to add to the comparison, I had a base Polestar as my rental. I liked how it drove, although it was not as immediately quick as the base model 3, I liked the regen braking better. Battery life seemed miles better. I missed the moon roof more than I thought I ever would though . 

I much prefer the Tesla infotainment but the Polestar one was a big step up on the old Volvo sensus and I liked that too so its deffo a good system, just not quite up to Teslas

I had to use PlugShare to find the fastest chargers that were close by, and those happened to be 40kW stations. I had to download an app and load money onto it for that to work.

BIGGEST NEGATIVE: driver assistance left much to desire. The lane assist kept bouncing me side to side in the lane and required me to apply force every 10 seconds or so or it would start beeping annoyingly. Adaptive cruise was okay but kept too much distance even at the smallest following setting.

Positives about the Polestar: range was quite good and the estimate was fairly accurate. Styling is pretty good although I couldnt tell if it wanted to be a small SUV or sedan. CarPlay was very nice although it required the phone to be plugged in. Birds eye parking view and rear cross traffic alert were nice to have.

Overall: I thought I might consider buying a Polestar if a great deal for a used one came up before trying out their driver assistance features.

"We have a 2022 Polestar 2 (base model if that matters) as well as a 2021 Model 3P (with the double paned glass).  The Polestar is far, far, quieter than the Model 3.  No interior rattles, very little wind noise.  Depending on the road surface, some tire noise is present.

In terms of ride harshness, it's smoother than the 3P, but I guess that's not a hard standard to beat.",2023-09-06 18:57:22,"Rented a Polestar 2




Full disclosure: Im a Tesla guy, with an old MS @160k miles and a 22 MYP.

I reserved a full size car from Hertz for a trip I am currently on. When I checked in they did not have any standard full size cars but offered me a Polestar instead for the same price. I asked about the charging situation and was told there are plenty so I agreed. The car was charged to 98% which made me take a mental note to never buy a prior rental EV. At first I hated the driving dynamics because regen braking was off. Once I figured that out it was actually a great drive, with strong regen braking all the way to a stop. Acceleration was snappy and similar to my S85 but much slower than the MYP. 

Negatives compared to Tesla: I know this will be controversial but the interior was just okay. There is a circular knob in front of the shifter for controlling volume.

"The rear window thing does seem very user hostile to me. From interior photos Ive seen, the glass roof does appear to extend pretty far behind the rear seats as do the rear quarter windows. I think its just going to be a matter of sitting back there and seeing how it feels.

Mirrors really are superior to screens for many reasons, you get natural depth and parallax with a mirror because its passing light directly to your eyes as it is in the real world, where a display is translating an image from a camera then flattening it onto a screen. The image on a mirror is also going to be a lot brighter with infinite contrast simply because its reflecting natural light, not generating light with LEDs.

Im really not sold on the concept of screens replacing mirrors until we come up with a display technology that can match the advantages of a mirror. You could implement eye tracking to simulate the depth and parallax, and LEDs keep getting brighter, OLED displays get close to natural contrast but are generally more fragile and shorter lived than LCD. Maybe once micro LED are practical?

Id really love to know if the lack of a rear window was a decision or a compromise. It doesnt really look like theyve done anything special with that space, theres just a window shaped metal panel where a window usually would be.",2023-11-10 14:01:32,"New Polestar 4 ride review

"I managed to find a side view photo of the P4 and resized it to be the same scale as an image of the EV6. I overlaid the images so that the point where the hood meets the windscreen is the same.

The two cars are a very similar shape, with the passenger cabins being nearly identical. The doors are the same general size and position and the rear wheel is in the same location.

The front windscreen of the P4 appears to have more of a curve than the EV6. This means that the A pillars are pushed slightly towards the back of the vehicle, and that the wing mirrors are also slightly further back. The rest of the front doors are pretty much the same size and shape.

The roofline is also a bit different above the rear quarter window. On the P4, the slope down towards the tail starts above the front edge of this window. On the EV6, the roof carries back towards the rear edge of this window before it starts to slope down. The height and placement of the rear spoiler lip is nearly identical.

The most pronounced difference is in the nose. The P4's nose is noticeably longer than the EV6's. This is due to the shape of the hood in front of the wheel arch. The EV6's hood curves down fairly quickly to meet the headlights, whereas the P4's nose follows a more conventional line. The P4's front wheel is also a few cm further rear than the EV6's.

It'll be very interesting to see pictures of the two cars parked side-by-side. The similarities might be even more striking.",2023-11-10 18:13:16,"New Polestar 4 ride review

"I rented an EV (Tesla model 3) last year from Hertz in Germany for 4 weeks. The experience was really good - no hassle to charge at the Superchargers and the satnav included the stops and durations automatically. They also gave me a shell recharge network key fob, which I didnt use (way to expensive; supercharger rates where around 39-59 Euro Cents per kilowatt hour for fast charging). The car was charged to 100% when I got it. Issue with EV rentals is that you have to return it with similar charge levels, which you have to plan for, so for short rentals this is indeed a big hassle. Also I wouldnt want any rental that hasnt supercharger charging included, so at this point I would really just rent a hassle free Tesla,and nothing else. Wallcharger (240 V plug) was in the frunk and it worked also. Due to the wall plug mess in Europe I could only use it in Germany, but not abroad.

They finally gave me one that I later found out autopilot didnt work on because one of the side cameras was broken. 

The 2nd time I rented a Y was a complete nightmare. I showed up at a supercharger about an hour away from the airport I picked it up at and the car started throwing BMS errors and wouldnt charge (meanwhile I watched multiple other people come and go and charge successfully). They also didnt give me the wall plug or the J1772 adapter so I was shit out of luck. I had to have them come and tow it. Then the next day they tried to tell me they never got the car back (despite it being towed by their driver and sitting the lot), then they tried blame me for running the battery too low (I had ~10% state of charge) and therefore the 12V battery was too low for it to charge, or some BS like that.

I had a Model 3 2021. Quality issues from day 1 (paint, rust, gaps, noise, breaking parts etc) Didnt like the rear hatch. Back seat uncomfortable for adults on long drives. Wish it had more physical controls for wipers, lights, climate. Noisy, uncomfortable ride. Didnt like the UI changes in some OTA updates that took away shortcuts. Constantly changing features, not always for the better. Automatic wipers never works.

-> Polestar 2 2024 seems much better built. Looks better. Ride feels more quiet (I measured it) and smoother (19 inch wheels). Better rear seats despite tunnel and better trunk hatch. Semi electric tow hook is convenient. Better and stronger lights (matrix). Android Auto is working well. Google assistant. Stores seat position for at least 4 users on the screen (havent tried adding more) Each user can have different apps and accounts for google, spotify, Netflix, youtube etc (could only have 1 spotify account in the Tesla). Easier to use screen while driving (bigger UI buttons is easier to tap without looking at the screen too much). Normal window frames. Normal doorhandles (with lights in them as a bonus). Better cruise control. Pilot assist might not steer as well as Autopilot in all situations, but works well on freeway/highway, and reactivates automatically when changing lanes.

Charge port is manually opened so it doesnt close before Im done inserting the charger, and It has a release button so I dont have to use the app or enter the car to release charger.

What do I miss? App had more functionality, but I only miss the ability to change maximum charge percentage from my phone. Hope they add it!

"I'm just going to spit out some things I find neat without a cogent order to them. I have not driven a P2. Please correct me if I'm underestimating it's capabilities at any point. (Also I'm going to abbreviate Model 3 as ""M3"". BMW enthusiasts may want to sit this out.)

After driving with blindspot monitors for a while now I'm fully convinced they're far and away superior to physical mirrors.

* Features like phone key comes standard on a M3, but are additional package upcharges for a P2. (Regarding Phone Key, they've also added support for UltraWideBand which is superior to Bluetooth.)

">Better infotainment hardware. If a M3 and a P2 are processing the same thing, route planning or w.e., the Ryzen powered hardware with in-house software in the M3 is going to do it faster.

Haven't owned any older Polestar2 but the 2024 Android UI is just as fast as my 2021 Model 3. Route planning is awesome with the Google Navigation. It plans charging stops, tells you how many stalls are available, and it is not limited to only Tesla Chargers, but includes even more charging providers. The app store has more apps than the Tesla Infotainment. I must admit I never used Teslas Netflix and Streaming apps much. Those apps were quite slow and laggy when I tested them in the Tesla, but the horisontal screen is nicer for movie streaming for sure, but I'm not that interested.

A bonus in the Polestar is that each driver can install their own apps and accounts, unlike Tesla where I could only have one Spotify account afaik. It also has better app selection, and additionally Apple Carplay (but wired only for now).

>The P2 has blindspot indicators while the M3 has blindspot indicators and monitors. After driving with blindspot monitors for a while now I'm fully convinced they're far and away superior to physical mirrors. They have a wider angle of vision, stay cleaner (almost supernaturally so), provide immediately apparent feedback (pulsing red warnings), and require significantly less head movement.

The Screen in the model 3 is in the center, and it was harder for me to refocus on that tiny image on the screen instead of just using the mirrors when changing lanes or turning. But the flashing red blindspot signal that came in an update shortly before I sold it helped. I prefer Polestars mirrors with blindspot indicators.

>Again, I haven't driven one, maybe 360 cam is the greatest human achievement since the moon landing and I'm ignorant to it's glory, but Tesla's new park assist is pretty uncontroversially ""good"". Generally speaking I continue to prefer the triple back-up cameras and then I'll briefly use the park assist to check my alignment/surroundings, etc. The inclusion of the blindspot cameras getting the view down the sides of your vehicle is just an awesome addition to the rear camera. You can reverse incredibly confidently.

The 360 camera and bumper camera is better IMO but is not perfect. The combination of USS sensors and cameras is helpful.

I liked the combination of 3 cameras on the Tesla too.  My model 3 had USS sensors, but like almost every Tesla I see I scratched up several rims on mine. Especially the front wheels is a huge blindspot.  I have not tested the new hifi park assist in Tesla. The cameras can tilt down automatically when reversing (as it could on the Tesla).

>Features like phone key comes standard on a M3, but are additional package upcharges for a P2. (Regarding Phone Key, they've also added support for UltraWideBand which is superior to Bluetooth.) I think if money is unlimited the P2 can get more features overall, but people vastly underestimate how much Tesla packs into their base trims. (Heated steering wheel, ventilated seats, autopilot, etc.)

The Cruise control and Radar feels better in the PS2. The Pilot assist will not always permit steering as often as the Tesla, but it works well on Highways. Sometimes even better the Teslas Autopilot, and it automatically re-engages when changing lanes. Phone key seems to work ok, but the Keyfob is even better (more range than the Phonekey on Tesla). The doors unlocks (more reliably) whenever you put your hand in the doorhandle. The rear hatch open when I put my foot under it, so it's hands free unlike the Tesla. The rear hatch is more practical too. The walkaway doorlock was nice on Tesla I admit. I often forgot to lock my other cars, but I'm getting used to it again now. PS2 locks by touching the doorhandle.

>The usual suspects such as the fantastic app, sentry mode, dashcam, route planning etc.

Route planning is just as good with Google with chargers and all, but you can download other apps in the car too. Google on your phone lets you send the route to the car. I only miss the option to set charging limit in the App. I hope Polestar fixes that. Didn't use the sentry feature in the app.

>Tesla does a lot of the little convenience things just right. The car saved my garage's location and tucks in the mirrors automatically when I approach.

My Polestar has heated wipers, but that was an part of an upgrade. All polestars have working rain sensors, Tesla does not. The traffic vizualisations seems more like a gimmick to sell FSD, I found it less useful and it took up a lot of space on the screen. I haven't experience low voltage issues, but the car is still new.

EDIT: Folding the mirrors is as simple as pressing the 2 mirror buttons if needed in the PS2. The GPS mirror feature was a nice touch in the M3 though, I liked it and used it in my garage too.

This can be used with automation apps too for neat functions like ""vent windows after I arrive at work in the summer"" or ""roll up windows when rain is approaching"".

Never used anything like that. Seems fun if you like to nerd out on your cars, but honestly most normal people won't. They just want a car that drives and doesn't have quality issues. The constant updates and changes to the car was more frustrating than enjoyable to me. One update removed the buttons for heating the windows and seats, and suddenly I had to dig into some menu to find it. Another update changed the Cruisecontrol to go directly to Autopilot, without asking any of the drivers. Suddenly it was trying to steer in an area where it was not supposed to. Tesla vision is a bit unreliable and would often be disabled by low sun or fog.

Teslas dash camera feature was nice though. I never got in a sitiuation where it was needed, but nice to have it anyways. Wish more cars would build it into the car. Maybe I'll get a third party solution. The sentry mode uses too much power since it keeps the car awake. When I went on a holiday I accidently drained my car at the airport even though I was sure it was turned off before I left the car.

Releasing the charger cable is a hassle on Tesla with type 2 cables in the EU Inconveniently you have to use the App or enter the car first. On most other EVs the car has a way to release the cable on the cars keyfob or outside directly on the chargeport.

Edit: Anyways thanks for a long detailed post. I tried adressing it with my experience from owning the PS2 only a short time. Hope it was helpful. Both cars has some pros and cons I think. 

Edit 2: Sorry I think I messed up part of my very long post  somehow. I hope it is fixed now.

Edit 3: When I switched to Polestar I didn't expect it to be as good as it is on the software, since I always heard Tesla was superior in that regard.

"Well maybe YOUR Audi did.  Mine was fine with the seats still looking great after well over a decade before I finally got rid of it for my current Volvo.  I had an Acura before that which also held up well.  But to my point the Chevy I had before that Acura I had for half as long as my Audi but the Chevy looked twice as old at 7 years then the Audi did at 14 years, with upholstery starting to droop and the paint/finish clearly looking worn with tons of rattles and shaking if I reached 80 mph.  My Audi had none of those issues.  And of course there were maintenance items to deal with on a 14 year old car.   But all it took was finding a good mechanic after I was out of warranty and it really wasnt that bad.

Yes sometimes a luxury car door closing with a solid THUNK rather than a cheaper car closing with a less solid CLAP is marketing.  But without fail every car Ive had that didnt close with a THUNK like the luxury brands I had started to have annoying rattles a few years in.  And yea from my test drives of Model 3/Ys they are much more CLAP than THUNK of luxury cars.  You see videos all the time of interior upholstery bits of brand new Teslas just slipping off exposing the interior of the door.  There was more road noise in my model 3 test drives than the at the time 11 year old Audi I had.  That stuff doesnt really inspire confidence.  Sure Tesla will come out and fix that stuff.  But it doesnt exactly feel like luxury.  No matter how much cool tech is in the car.",2023-06-14 05:59:24,"2024 Polestar 2 Starts At $51,300, Deliveries Begin In August

">STOCKHOLM, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Volvo Cars (VOLCARb.ST), said on Thursday it would stop funding Polestar Automotive Holding and was handing responsibility for the struggling luxury car brand over to Volvo's top shareholder China's Geely Holding.  
>  
>The announcement sent the Swedish automaker's stock up more than 30% at market open.
>  
>The heavy involvement by Swedish-listed Volvo Cars in Polestar, where it owns around 48% of the shares, has been criticised by analysts who see the stake as a drag on Volvo's resources.
>  
>Like other new EV brands and startups, Polestar has struggled to make headway, particularly since Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab started a price war last year. The automaker said earlier this month that it had missed its already-reduced delivery targets for 2023.
>  
>Polestar's shares are down just over 83% since it went public in June 2022 via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC.
>  
>Volvo Cars said it has considered handing Polestar shares over to Volvo's shareholders, which would make Geely a big direct owner in the brand.
>  
>Shares in Volvo were up 20% at 0814 GMT, after they soared 32% at market open. Geely in a separate statement welcomed Volvo's decision to focus its resources on its own development.
>  
>""Geely Holding will continue to provide full operational and financial support to the independent exclusive (Polestar) brand going forward,"" the Chinese group said. ""This support will not require a reduction of Geely Holding shareholding in Volvo Cars,"" it added.
>  
>However, the broker Bernstein said it saw a distinct possibility that the Geely ecosystem could sell down its shares in Volvo.
>  
>Polestar last week said it planned to cut around 450 jobs globally, or about 15% of its workforce, amid ""challenging market conditions"".
>  
>It also said in November that it would try to reduce its reliance on external help, publishing a revised business plan, which included getting additional loans from Volvo and Geely.
>  
>The news could raise questions about the viability of Polestar, which aims to become cash flow break-even in 2025. Some analysts have said it could make more sense to fold Polestar company into Geely.

"I would disagree for sure. I test drove a Toyota, Tesla, and this, and was coming from Toyota/Hyundai/Jeep.

The interior of the Polestar is of course not like a Rolls Royce or something, but it is definitely much more premium and better quality than the Tesla or Toyota. Unfortunately Tesla in particular uses a lot of flash and technology to give the illusion of quality but the materials and build felt really cheap. Toyota didn't bother with that so both felt and looked cheap (although was the most expensive option).

The polestar had a great look and feel and was just pieced together very well. I would perhaps market it somewhere similar to Volvo, Audi, Lexus, not really upper-market but a bit more premium than what you'd get from your typical car perhaps.

The upcoming EX90 and Polestar 3 are examples of two differently-positioned cars with some parts sharing on a common platform.

Glad he added that. 

I don't get the appeal of strip lighting stretching across the interior - the time it's most dramatic is at night, which is also when it's most unwelcome. It's the ultimate gimmick for when a manufacturer has run out of ideas to make their interior ""different"". Mercedes were the most egregious example, but others have unfortunately followed them.

Saab had the right idea back in the day - a way of *reducing* ambient light across the interior, so you're not blinded by glare at night.",2023-09-21 12:31:33,"Polestar 3 Designer Criticizes Cars Shaped Like A Potato For The Sake Of Aero

"Every published EV review contains a sweaty, trembling paragraph on range and fast-enough recharging.

I'm amazed, given the near-hysterical obsession with range and short road-trip stops - ""Hit the toilet, kids: you have 150 seconds to be back, or you're left behind!"" - that there's no market for pit-crew like service, adult diaper bins, bidets, and toilets right next to the pumps.

 The list of buyer preferences should therefore run like this:

1. High MPGe (low weight, low coefficient of drag and low rolling-resistance tires are the way) - 140 should be the minimum MPGe
2. 800V architecture with liquid-cooled batteries. The charging-speed advantages are too profound to ignore, and don't require huge batteries (weight); boosts the charging speed of any size of battery
3. In-car toilet with bidet - no more bathroom stops - and ample cup holders and bins for Ensure, Pedialyte and energy bars
4. Sophisticated AI-based radar/lidar detectors
5. Spotter crews, ground-based or  in Cessnas, to alert for smokeys
6. Looks

I have learned that the American road trip is a cannonball run, and the primary mission in mind is the shortest road time on a 750-mile-plus trip. No matter that 95% of mileage is commuting or errands.

The need for slightly more solar panels to power a less efficient electric car is a negligible investment over time.  Likewise, the albedo difference between those extra solar panels and the ground/roof is probably not going to make much of a difference on a global scale.

">Big battery is the primary reason for high price.

Hard disagree. Batteries sit at around $150/kWh, so even a 100kWh battery would only be $15,000. Plenty of companies sell an entire ICE car for that kind of money (at least in Europe), so it should be perfectly plausible to sell a long-range no-frills EV for around $30-35k, even without deducting the savings from not needing to manufacture an engine, transmission etc.

EVs being sold for $50k+ aren't marked up due to battery costs. They're marked up for all the ""luxury"" features like ""autopilot"" and ""fart mode"". Heated and powered seats, all that nonsense. 

The biggest luxury for me is never needing to charge except at home. I get in the car, I drive to my destination, and afterwards I drive home. I don't mind paying for a big battery to achieve that - I just don't want to fork out for all the fluff that comes with it.

That said, I absolutely agree that most people don't need a 100kWh battery, and that a small, cheap EV with a 30-50kWh battery is fine for commuting/errands/general city use.

And this is why I'd say heated seats are a luxury. I'm sure they're nice, but as long as the vehicle has heating of some sort I'm happy. Especially in an EV, where you can preheat the vehicle anyway before getting in (which is also a luxury, but is essentially a software change not a hardware one).

Sitting into a -10C car especially if you have a cold is not a good idea. You may not afford the extra time heating up the car or putting on gloves every morning. Being able to heat the surfaces you touch falls into the ""want"" category for me, provided there are several cold nights in a year.  

Note, I don't have seat nor steering wheel heating.

Oh yeah, it'd be nice. But it doesn't need to be in every car at the expense of affordability.

What is a carpet if not a mat for the floor? What kind of floor coverings are being fitted that need protection from having feet placed upon them?

"Does telsa have controls to change the cabin temp on the steering wheel that you can get to with out looking at anything else?   I honestly don't know which is why I am asking.

In my case I can point to say my Mach E.  It has a dedicated temp location on the screen and it never moves but I still would call it a touch screen control.  Being dedicated touch screen control does not cover what I am talking ab out.  It needs physical feed back and be able to feel the control by touch alone.  The Mach E fails at that requirement.  Now mind you once I touch it once I can do bigger adjustments with volume knob which is nice but still the first action is a touch screen which I call bad.

* temperature control.
* Heated/Cooled seat controls
* Heated steering wheel
* volume control
* all safety related items (headlights, cruise control, blinkers, hazards, wipers)
* maybe fan speed for climate control but I can give a pass on that one.

">  Even Tesla the voice controls are going to have to many issues. Base that completely on voice issues and control issues that Google, Apple and Amazon are running into which lets be honest are going to be better than Tesla.

I get that sentiment, but it's not really true.  I hate Siri.  Google is a lot better, but I'm not sure if it's the limited things you can do in the car with voice, but it just works.  Specifically how fast it is is great.  It's as good as Google when entering in a destination in nav, in fact it might be Google, not sure.  For commands it's better than anything I've used.

Sure all the same limitations apply, mainly if you don't want to use voice because you are talking or listening to something and don't want to pause it to use a voice command.  It's not like Alexa where you have to shout over it, you start the command by pressing the right scroll wheel, which pauses the audio and waits for a command.  Processing the command is sub-second to maybe a second.  Hard to tell because it's fast.

>  If all it does is temperature it gets a pass but if the left scroll wheel is used for other function it is fail.

So it's not a simple button so I'm not sure what you would consider a fail.  It's a scroll wheel that can also be pushed like the middle scroll on a mouse.  Unlike a mouse it also pushes left/right as well.  Then you have the long push functions.  It's very natural and the only things to learn are the long push options which is where the fan, temp and audio source are.  It 100% muscle memory.  It's easy to discover too as you just try it and it's obvious what it's doing.

>  It fails on the safety part for example as side mirrors are controlled by the touch screen.

See this I don't get.  I set my side mirrors up 4 years ago and have never needed to adjust them despite 4 separate driving the car all the time.  Tesla have infinite profiles and they are tied to your phone.  When I open the door, the side mirrors, seats, vents, default audio source, volume and all settings are set to the way I last left it.  The rear view mirror is the only thing not set and it's annoying every time because everyone uses the Tesla in my household.

> I also feel like for basic controls from the list I made earlier cars should strive to similar to each other.

I just got a BMW a few weeks ago and I've been going crazy because when I reverse the mirrors point at the ground.  I couldn't find the setting to turn that off and finally had to Google it.  Turns out the mirror switch on the door controls it.  If it's set to adjust the left mirror the mirrors will point down when you go into reverse.

"I would prefer hard data to anecdote, but heres my own experience driving a car with a giant touchscreen:

I generally DONT choose to interact with it while driving. When I want to navigate somewhere, I press a button on my steering wheel and say navigate to 10 Main Street, wherever and it does it. It also programs in my charge stops automatically. When I want to play a song, I press that same button and say play Fast Car by Tracy Chapman and the song starts playing. If I want to turn on my heated seat and Im in traffic, I press that same button and say turn on drivers heated seat.

I cannot think of anything complicated that I do through the touchscreen while driving. I occasionally nudge the cabin temperature, but only because it is so close and easy to do without looking. I wouldnt choose to do even that when other cars were near.

Now, thinking back to my previous car with no touchscreen and tons of buttons When I needed gas, I used to pull out my phone at red lights and look at the GasBuddy app. When I wanted a song, I requested it through my phone, which was connected to the car through Bluetooth. When I wanted to navigate somewhere, I either used google maps on my phone or an incredibly horrible onboard nav system that made me spin a wheel for each letter in the name of the street, town, etc. (Holy cow was that slow and distracting.)

There were enough buttons grouped together that I always had to look when adjusting temperature.

My backup camera was a lot smaller and less helpful. The onboard nav display was also smaller and required more squinting and uncertainty to use.

Despite the lack of touchscreen, there was a built in feature that let you browse upcoming exit info to find restaurants, hotels, etc. You used it with a physical dial and buttons. This feature was actually very helpful but really difficult for the driver to use safely.

When a text came in, it was very tempting to look at my phone. There was no option to have the car read it to me.

Ditto for phone calls. My new car shows the name of the caller on the screen in a place that is easy to quickly glance. In my old car, I would have to fish out my phone to see that and to decide whether to use the steering wheel buttons to answer.

The genie is out of the bottle with smart phones. As much as we want every driver to give their full attention to the road, they are going to try to multitask. That is why the onboard systems exist  because they take over some of those handheld phone features in a somewhat safer way.

The right way to analyze safety here is:

1) Somehow observe typical drivers without affecting their behavior through monitoring. (No one will use a cell phone while they are part of a study, and it is not ethical to ask them to do it, but we know that people do it all the time on the roads.)

2) Use actual crash statistics to cross check safety across car models. If a cars controls seem distracting and unsafe, but its drivers have fewer accidents, then keep digging in and figure out why. What behavior did those distracting controls replace?",2023-06-13 12:21:06,"What's the more likely scenario - Tesla, Rivian, Polestar adding back physical controls, or GM, Ford, Hyundai removing them?

"No, it's just that it's a bad solution. There's a reason the debate is generally between touchscreen versus physical buttons, with voice control unmentioned. Depending on voice control for critical functions is a deeply unserious proposal. For one thing, the list of what-ifs is much longer than other methods:

- Language barrier or thick accent
- Auditory impairment or speech defect
- Screaming kids in the back seat confusing commands
- Not wanting to interrupt a phone call to talk to your car
- Laryngitis

"This generally coheres with my impression as someone also with 2x P2s. Couple other points Id make:

Relative to the i4, the hatch and rear bench on the P2 seemed ever so slightly more spacious. At least my standard test is seeing if my kids car seats can fit in the trunk and how comfortable they are in the car seats in the back bench. The car seats didnt fit in either the i4 or Model 3, and my kids preferred the space in the P2 over the i4 at least. Rear bench on the Model 3 is more a wash vs the P2. 

Also on the i4 it seems you have to flip to B to engage one pedal drive each time, which seems like would get annoying. I dont know if theres a way to specify that  as a default in software but neither I nor the sales guy could figure it out during my test drive. 

Finally, its subjective, but I prefer the pedal tuning and general driving setup most out of the P2 vs Model 3 or i4. Havent tested the ioniq6 yet.",2023-05-15 04:48:57,"Long Term Review and Analysis of the Polestar 2




I have two 2022 Polestar 2's. One is a DM Pilot/Plus and the other is a DM Pilot. I will give a few separate notes for each but the general review is the same. 

The Polestar 2 might not stand out in any particular way from its competition, but it makes up for it in being a holistic package. It seems like it tries to be everything, and while it doesn't always excel, it never really fails either. It doesn't have any huge drawbacks that make it unfeasible. Additionally, its the small unnoticed things from the car that come together to make it great, like how it automatically turns on the 360 camera when you slow down, the smooth braking and acceleration, intuitive infotainment and more. 

The following is a breakdown of certain components as it compares to its primary competition, which I see as the Tesla Model 3, the BMW i4, and the Hyundai Ioniq 6.

Appearance: 10/10 

Of course, this is subjective, but the competitors are really quite ugly. 

I would go PS2 > TM3 > i4 > Iq6

Value: 7/10

Compared with the 47k Model 3 that is eligible for the tax credit, the Polestar has a hard time competing. Additionally, the single motor Polestar has a tough competitor against the single motor i4. But, the fact that the i4 charges around 12k for AWD while the PS2 charges only 3.5 makes the PS2 a better deal unless you really need that extra power (which you probably don't). Comparing the PS2 to the i4 M50, the numbers are not all that bad. Of course, the Tesla beats everything on value. Still, the PS2 is like an electric 3 series, and it has price parity with an M340i, which is an ICE car. The Ioniq 6 is priced a good amount better. 

Now, if you can get a lightly used Polestar 2 for around 37k, that is a great deal. Probably a 10/10 for value. 

TM3 > Iq6 > PS2 > i4

Usability: 10/10

The infotainment is really quite easy to use and get used to. The gear selector is nice to use and the screen in front of the driver is useful, especially with the map. The hatch trunk is practical as well, which the i4 shares, but the TM3 and Ioniq 6 do not. The ground clearance and bit higher seating position can come in handy as well, though it does not do too many favors for the side profile. The usability is where I think the car really shines. The small things like the hook in the glove box, the card holder on the windshield, the automatic appearance of the 360 camera, the lights on the doors, and more show the car was built to be convenient and useable. Getting into a Tesla at first can be a bit confusing because of the new approach and how most things are buried into the screen. The Ioniq 6 also has some good usability as it still retains many physical controls. The i4 is a bit less usable than the Polestar 2 because its A/C controls are on a horizontal screen that is a bit farther out and slightly more inconvenient to reach.

PS2 > i4 > Iq6 > TM3

Driving Experience: 9/10

The drive is both engaging and confidence inspiring. The acceleration and braking is smooth and easy to get used to. The car is very predictable and stable. The car is fast but not uncomfortably so. While there are much faster cars, such as the TM3 P and i4 M50, I rarely if ever floor the car. The i4 m50 also handles better, but the price differential might not be worth it for someone who is not looking for the best handling. The speed it has is more than sufficient and enjoyable. 

i4 > TM3 and PS2 > Iq6

Reliability: 8/10

The car has some random software issues that pop up. However, these rarely interrupt the cars ability to drive. 

Not sure here for rankings

App: 3/10

Fairly bad. Requires me to press the start climate 4-5 times to work if at all. Takes a long time to load. Limited useful functionality. It is supposedly improving but we shall see. 

TM3 > i4 > Iq6 > PS2

Interior quality and comfort: 7.5/ 10

The interior is made of some nice feeling materials. It is quite unique and I have taken quite a liking to it. It's cockpit feel might not be for everyone. Also, that large center console can sometimes get in the way. The normal seats are not bad, but basic cloth on a 50k car is a bit strange. The Weavetech is also not bad, but the normal cloth is actually a bit softer and more comfortable. The Weavetech does feel more durable though. The single cupholder is not ideal, but is not really a deal breaker. 

Without the plus pack, the standard seats do not come with automated reclining controls. They come with some extremely annoying dial that is fairly hard to move. If you have one driver you can usually just set it and forget. Multiple drivers make it a pain. 

Road noise is okay. Nothing spectacular. The suspension is a bit stiff but not uncomfortable. Sound systems are good for the average listener. 

i4 > PS2 > Iq6 > TM3

Visibility and Lights: 7/10

The rear visibility is a joke. The pixel headlights are nice and the front and rear headlights look great. The light bending feature works well. I patiently await the adaptive high beams. The car is great for night driving unless you are going in reverse. Maybe the rear fog lights can help a bit there but not too much. 

Not sure

Charging and Range: 7/10

The range is around 260 miles. Nothing amazing, but perfectly good for normal commutes. The charging is also average, but still acceptable for road trips. Tesla has its charging network. 

TM3 > IQ6 > i4 > PS2

Features: 8/10

The car does not have too many cool features like V2L (like Ioniq 6) or even a heads-up display (Like Ioniq 6 and i4) but the Google operating system is interesting and definitely a step up from OEM systems. The OTA updates are semi-frequent and sometimes introduce nice features. As Android Automotive expands, I hope the car will get some more nice features. 

Not sure, depends on personal preference of features

If you are looking for the best car in the segment without consideration of price, you might look at the i4 M50. If you are looking for the greatest value in the segment, you would look at the Model 3. If you don't care too much about performance and want a feature packed car, you could look at the Ioniq 6. But if you want something that is a mix of them all, the Polestar might be for you. The Polestar is that middle ground, between the i4 and TM3 on both price, luxury, and the traditional car feel. If you are looking for a little bit of everything, the Polestar 2 has you covered.

The Caveat: Back in 2021, you could get a Polestar 2 with the tax credit and 0% financing. At that time, that was around the same price at the Model 3 since it did not get the tax credit. The i4 had an extremely long wait time while the Polestar 2 was easily available at MSRP. The Ioniq 6 was not out. At that time, the Polestar 2 was a great buy, perhaps easily the best buy in the segment. It gave a more traditional car feel than the Tesla and some nice features like 360 camera, rear cross traffic alert, and a driver's dash. All that at the expense of some range. It was around 10-15k cheaper than a similarly speced i4 m50 while being readily available and at MSRP. It gave around 90% of what the i4 m50 gave at 75% of the price. And remember, at 0% financing. But now, the TM3 is far cheaper and the i4 is available. The Ioniq 6 is out and if it is at MSRP, that is also a great deal. The PS2 has lost the tax credit while the TM3 has gained it. So, the Polestar 2 is a bit of a hard buy now. The Polestar 2 is not the best deal it once was. Even though it has price parity to some ICE competitors, like an M340i and is cheaper than an i4 m50, it still does not compete as strongly, when, if you are eligible for the tax credit, you can get a TM3 LR for 39k. 

However, hope is not gone. This is because you can find used Polestar 2's quite easily for around 37-42k. At this price, it is a great buy depending on the trim and features. At that price, the Polestar 2's features really shine and its status as a great all rounder really comes to shine even brighter. 

Additional: With the 2024 updates, we expect the driving dynamics to improve as well as specs for the single motor variant, which are currently quite underwhelming. Depending on the price changes, these could serve to make the Polestar 2 fairly competitive again. 

TLDR: Overall rating: 9/10  The Polestar 2 might not excel in any single field, but it makes up for it by being a great all rounder. Especially if you get it used for a great price.",Reddit

Without the plus pack, the standard seats do not come with automated reclining controls. They come with some extremely annoying dial that is fairly hard to move. If you have one driver you can usually just set it and forget. Multiple drivers make it a pain. 

Road noise is okay. Nothing spectacular. The suspension is a bit stiff but not uncomfortable. Sound systems are good for the average listener.

Visibility and Lights: 7/10

The rear visibility is a joke. The pixel headlights are nice and the front and rear headlights look great. The light bending feature works well. I patiently await the adaptive high beams. The car is great for night driving unless you are going in reverse. Maybe the rear fog lights can help a bit there but not too much.

Charging and Range: 7/10

The range is around 260 miles. Nothing amazing, but perfectly good for normal commutes. The charging is also average, but still acceptable for road trips. Tesla has its charging network. 

TM3 > IQ6 > i4 > PS2

Features: 8/10

The car does not have too many cool features like V2L (like Ioniq 6) or even a heads-up display (Like Ioniq 6 and i4) but the Google operating system is interesting and definitely a step up from OEM systems. The OTA updates are semi-frequent and sometimes introduce nice features. As Android Automotive expands, I hope the car will get some more nice features.

If you are looking for the best car in the segment without consideration of price, you might look at the i4 M50. If you are looking for the greatest value in the segment, you would look at the Model 3. If you don't care too much about performance and want a feature packed car, you could look at the Ioniq 6. But if you want something that is a mix of them all, the Polestar might be for you. The Polestar is that middle ground, between the i4 and TM3 on both price, luxury, and the traditional car feel. If you are looking for a little bit of everything, the Polestar 2 has you covered.

The Caveat: Back in 2021, you could get a Polestar 2 with the tax credit and 0% financing. At that time, that was around the same price at the Model 3 since it did not get the tax credit. The i4 had an extremely long wait time while the Polestar 2 was easily available at MSRP. The Ioniq 6 was not out. At that time, the Polestar 2 was a great buy, perhaps easily the best buy in the segment. It gave a more traditional car feel than the Tesla and some nice features like 360 camera, rear cross traffic alert, and a driver's dash. All that at the expense of some range. It was around 10-15k cheaper than a similarly speced i4 m50 while being readily available and at MSRP. It gave around 90% of what the i4 m50 gave at 75% of the price. And remember, at 0% financing. But now, the TM3 is far cheaper and the i4 is available. The Ioniq 6 is out and if it is at MSRP, that is also a great deal. The PS2 has lost the tax credit while the TM3 has gained it. So, the Polestar 2 is a bit of a hard buy now. The Polestar 2 is not the best deal it once was. Even though it has price parity to some ICE competitors, like an M340i and is cheaper than an i4 m50, it still does not compete as strongly, when, if you are eligible for the tax credit, you can get a TM3 LR for 39k. 

However, hope is not gone. This is because you can find used Polestar 2's quite easily for around 37-42k. At this price, it is a great buy depending on the trim and features. At that price, the Polestar 2's features really shine and its status as a great all rounder really comes to shine even brighter. 

Additional: With the 2024 updates, we expect the driving dynamics to improve as well as specs for the single motor variant, which are currently quite underwhelming. Depending on the price changes, these could serve to make the Polestar 2 fairly competitive again. 

TLDR: Overall rating: 9/10  The Polestar 2 might not excel in any single field, but it makes up for it by being a great all rounder. Especially if you get it used for a great price.",Reddit
"Hey, I've been waiting on a MachE for close to a year and this vehicle just caught my eye. It's readily available but the dealer is a bit of a drive away.

Just curious, do you think the front seats would be squished with rear facing car seats in the back? How does the space compare to the Ionic 5 or Mach E?

I have two 2022 Polestar 2's. One is a DM Pilot/Plus and the other is a DM Pilot. I will give a few separate notes for each but the general review is the same. 

The Polestar 2 might not stand out in any particular way from its competition, but it makes up for it in being a holistic package. It seems like it tries to be everything, and while it doesn't always excel, it never really fails either. It doesn't have any huge drawbacks that make it unfeasible. Additionally, its the small unnoticed things from the car that come together to make it great, like how it automatically turns on the 360 camera when you slow down, the smooth braking and acceleration, intuitive infotainment and more. 

The following is a breakdown of certain components as it compares to its primary competition, which I see as the Tesla Model 3, the BMW i4, and the Hyundai Ioniq 6.

Appearance: 10/10 

Of course, this is subjective, but the competitors are really quite ugly. 

I would go PS2 > TM3 > i4 > Iq6

Value: 7/10

Compared with the 47k Model 3 that is eligible for the tax credit, the Polestar has a hard time competing. Additionally, the single motor Polestar has a tough competitor against the single motor i4. But, the fact that the i4 charges around 12k for AWD while the PS2 charges only 3.5 makes the PS2 a better deal unless you really need that extra power (which you probably don't). Comparing the PS2 to the i4 M50, the numbers are not all that bad. Of course, the Tesla beats everything on value. Still, the PS2 is like an electric 3 series, and it has price parity with an M340i, which is an ICE car. The Ioniq 6 is priced a good amount better. 

Now, if you can get a lightly used Polestar 2 for around 37k, that is a great deal. Probably a 10/10 for value. 

TM3 > Iq6 > PS2 > i4

Usability: 10/10

The infotainment is really quite easy to use and get used to. The gear selector is nice to use and the screen in front of the driver is useful, especially with the map. The hatch trunk is practical as well, which the i4 shares, but the TM3 and Ioniq 6 do not. The ground clearance and bit higher seating position can come in handy as well, though it does not do too many favors for the side profile. The usability is where I think the car really shines. The small things like the hook in the glove box, the card holder on the windshield, the automatic appearance of the 360 camera, the lights on the doors, and more show the car was built to be convenient and useable. Getting into a Tesla at first can be a bit confusing because of the new approach and how most things are buried into the screen. The Ioniq 6 also has some good usability as it still retains many physical controls. The i4 is a bit less usable than the Polestar 2 because its A/C controls are on a horizontal screen that is a bit farther out and slightly more inconvenient to reach.

PS2 > i4 > Iq6 > TM3

Driving Experience: 9/10

The drive is both engaging and confidence inspiring. The acceleration and braking is smooth and easy to get used to. The car is very predictable and stable. The car is fast but not uncomfortably so. While there are much faster cars, such as the TM3 P and i4 M50, I rarely if ever floor the car. The i4 m50 also handles better, but the price differential might not be worth it for someone who is not looking for the best handling. The speed it has is more than sufficient and enjoyable. 

i4 > TM3 and PS2 > Iq6

Reliability: 8/10

The car has some random software issues that pop up. However, these rarely interrupt the cars ability to drive. 

Not sure here for rankings

App: 3/10

Fairly bad. Requires me to press the start climate 4-5 times to work if at all. Takes a long time to load. Limited useful functionality. It is supposedly improving but we shall see. 

TM3 > i4 > Iq6 > PS2

Interior quality and comfort: 7.5/ 10

The interior is made of some nice feeling materials. It is quite unique and I have taken quite a liking to it. It's cockpit feel might not be for everyone. Also, that large center console can sometimes get in the way. The normal seats are not bad, but basic cloth on a 50k car is a bit strange. The Weavetech is also not bad, but the normal cloth is actually a bit softer and more comfortable. The Weavetech does feel more durable though. The single cupholder is not ideal, but is not really a deal breaker. 

Without the plus pack, the standard seats do not come with automated reclining controls. They come with some extremely annoying dial that is fairly hard to move. If you have one driver you can usually just set it and forget. Multiple drivers make it a pain.

At that price, the Polestar 2's features really shine and its status as a great all rounder really comes to shine even brighter.

I have two 2022 Polestar 2's. One is a DM Pilot/Plus and the other is a DM Pilot. I will give a few separate notes for each but the general review is the same. 

The Polestar 2 might not stand out in any particular way from its competition, but it makes up for it in being a holistic package. It seems like it tries to be everything, and while it doesn't always excel, it never really fails either. It doesn't have any huge drawbacks that make it unfeasible. Additionally, its the small unnoticed things from the car that come together to make it great, like how it automatically turns on the 360 camera when you slow down, the smooth braking and acceleration, intuitive infotainment and more. 

The following is a breakdown of certain components as it compares to its primary competition, which I see as the Tesla Model 3, the BMW i4, and the Hyundai Ioniq 6.

Appearance: 10/10 

Of course, this is subjective, but the competitors are really quite ugly. 

I would go PS2 > TM3 > i4 > Iq6

Value: 7/10

Compared with the 47k Model 3 that is eligible for the tax credit, the Polestar has a hard time competing. Additionally, the single motor Polestar has a tough competitor against the single motor i4. But, the fact that the i4 charges around 12k for AWD while the PS2 charges only 3.5 makes the PS2 a better deal unless you really need that extra power (which you probably don't). Comparing the PS2 to the i4 M50, the numbers are not all that bad. Of course, the Tesla beats everything on value. Still, the PS2 is like an electric 3 series, and it has price parity with an M340i, which is an ICE car. The Ioniq 6 is priced a good amount better. 

Now, if you can get a lightly used Polestar 2 for around 37k, that is a great deal. Probably a 10/10 for value. 

TM3 > Iq6 > PS2 > i4

Usability: 10/10

The infotainment is really quite easy to use and get used to. The gear selector is nice to use and the screen in front of the driver is useful, especially with the map. The hatch trunk is practical as well, which the i4 shares, but the TM3 and Ioniq 6 do not. The ground clearance and bit higher seating position can come in handy as well, though it does not do too many favors for the side profile. The usability is where I think the car really shines. The small things like the hook in the glove box, the card holder on the windshield, the automatic appearance of the 360 camera, the lights on the doors, and more show the car was built to be convenient and useable. Getting into a Tesla at first can be a bit confusing because of the new approach and how most things are buried into the screen. The Ioniq 6 also has some good usability as it still retains many physical controls. The i4 is a bit less usable than the Polestar 2 because its A/C controls are on a horizontal screen that is a bit farther out and slightly more inconvenient to reach.

PS2 > i4 > Iq6 > TM3

Driving Experience: 9/10

The drive is both engaging and confidence inspiring. The acceleration and braking is smooth and easy to get used to. The car is very predictable and stable. The car is fast but not uncomfortably so. While there are much faster cars, such as the TM3 P and i4 M50, I rarely if ever floor the car. The i4 m50 also handles better, but the price differential might not be worth it for someone who is not looking for the best handling. The speed it has is more than sufficient and enjoyable. 

i4 > TM3 and PS2 > Iq6

Reliability: 8/10

The car has some random software issues that pop up. However, these rarely interrupt the cars ability to drive. 

Not sure here for rankings

App: 3/10

Fairly bad. Requires me to press the start climate 4-5 times to work if at all. Takes a long time to load. Limited useful functionality. It is supposedly improving but we shall see. 

TM3 > i4 > Iq6 > PS2

Interior quality and comfort: 7.5/ 10

The interior is made of some nice feeling materials. It is quite unique and I have taken quite a liking to it. It's cockpit feel might not be for everyone. Also, that large center console can sometimes get in the way. The normal seats are not bad, but basic cloth on a 50k car is a bit strange. The Weavetech is also not bad, but the normal cloth is actually a bit softer and more comfortable. The Weavetech does feel more durable though. The single cupholder is not ideal, but is not really a deal breaker. 

Without the plus pack, the standard seats do not come with automated reclining controls. They come with some extremely annoying dial that is fairly hard to move. If you have one driver you can usually just set it and forget. Multiple drivers make it a pain. 

Road noise is okay. Nothing spectacular. The suspension is a bit stiff but not uncomfortable. Sound systems are good for the average listener. 

i4 > PS2 > Iq6 > TM3

Visibility and Lights: 7/10

The rear visibility is a joke. The pixel headlights are nice and the front and rear headlights look great. The light bending feature works well. I patiently await the adaptive high beams. The car is great for night driving unless you are going in reverse. Maybe the rear fog lights can help a bit there but not too much. 

Not sure

Charging and Range: 7/10

The range is around 260 miles. Nothing amazing, but perfectly good for normal commutes. The charging is also average, but still acceptable for road trips. Tesla has its charging network. 

TM3 > IQ6 > i4 > PS2

Features: 8/10

The car does not have too many cool features like V2L (like Ioniq 6) or even a heads-up display (Like Ioniq 6 and i4) but the Google operating system is interesting and definitely a step up from OEM systems. The OTA updates are semi-frequent and sometimes introduce nice features. As Android Automotive expands, I hope the car will get some more nice features. 

Not sure, depends on personal preference of features

&#x200B;

If you are looking for the best car in the segment without consideration of price, you might look at the i4 M50. If you are looking for the greatest value in the segment, you would look at the Model 3. If you don't care too much about performance and want a feature packed car, you could look at the Ioniq 6. But if you want something that is a mix of them all, the Polestar might be for you. The Polestar is that middle ground, between the i4 and TM3 on both price, luxury, and the traditional car feel. If you are looking for a little bit of everything, the Polestar 2 has you covered.

The Caveat: Back in 2021, you could get a Polestar 2 with the tax credit and 0% financing. At that time, that was around the same price at the Model 3 since it did not get the tax credit. The i4 had an extremely long wait time while the Polestar 2 was easily available at MSRP. The Ioniq 6 was not out. At that time, the Polestar 2 was a great buy, perhaps easily the best buy in the segment. It gave a more traditional car feel than the Tesla and some nice features like 360 camera, rear cross traffic alert, and a driver's dash. All that at the expense of some range. It was around 10-15k cheaper than a similarly speced i4 m50 while being readily available and at MSRP. It gave around 90% of what the i4 m50 gave at 75% of the price. And remember, at 0% financing. But now, the TM3 is far cheaper and the i4 is available. The Ioniq 6 is out and if it is at MSRP, that is also a great deal. The PS2 has lost the tax credit while the TM3 has gained it. So, the Polestar 2 is a bit of a hard buy now. The Polestar 2 is not the best deal it once was. Even though it has price parity to some ICE competitors, like an M340i and is cheaper than an i4 m50, it still does not compete as strongly, when, if you are eligible for the tax credit, you can get a TM3 LR for 39k. 

However, hope is not gone. This is because you can find used Polestar 2's quite easily for around 37-42k. At this price, it is a great buy depending on the trim and features. At that price, the Polestar 2's features really shine and its status as a great all rounder really comes to shine even brighter. 

Additional: With the 2024 updates, we expect the driving dynamics to improve as well as specs for the single motor variant, which are currently quite underwhelming. Depending on the price changes, these could serve to make the Polestar 2 fairly competitive again.

"Under-rated comment. This is why they call EVs being at the ""iPhone"" moment. A long time ago, when Top Gear was in the Clarkson/Hammond/May era, luxury cars would have something special like ""electric windows"" or ""heated seats"". Now pretty much all cars have all the bells and whistles as standard.

Why do people buy an EV now? Tesla knew what they were doing when they built out the Supercharger network and it's a killer USP. When they lose that advantage as they open it up it will get a lot tougher for them.

Now phones all look the same they fight mainly over cost, and the main differentiator seems to be how good the camera is on the back. For cars it will be price and range until they crack FSD which will be the next game changer.

"Polestar selling the 2 was both a blessing and a curse for them.

On one hand, they got a car to help build their brand with minimal relative effort - a nearly-finished Volvo (S40) handed to them on a silver platter, only needing its badges swapped out and some slightly different interior design to match the brand's vision before going on sale.

But on the other hand, the brand they publicly have wanted to build is a Porsche to Volvo's Audi. So in chasing volume with the 2, they're diluting the image and prestige of this brand they want to build up because it's being constantly compared to cars in lower market segments like the Tesla Model 3.

"The Polestar 2 is literally an XC40 ""sedan"". It debuted as a Volvo concept (See [here](https://www.netcarshow.com/volvo/2016-40.1_concept/1600x1200/wallpaper_01.htm) and [here](https://www.netcarshow.com/volvo/2016-40.2_concept/1600x1200/wallpaper_01.htm)) and, while technically this has never been publicly proven, it was in all likelihood slated to be the third-generation Volvo S40 before Geely and Volvo spun off Polestar as its own brand.

And it was originally going to have ICE, PHEV, and BEV powertrains just like the XC40 has now. It's one of the reasons why the interior is so ""cramped"" compared to its competition, it's an ICE car with an EV drivetrain and batteries.

As for the Polestar 3... I don't think the EX90 is anything to worry about. And there's enough differentiation between the 3 and the Eletre to not get too much overlap...

"Again, the Polestar 2 is part of that ""problem"". It's absolutely a lower-market car than what they aspire the brand to be. But it's the car that, IMO, most people now associate with the Polestar brand. Since, y'know, it's the only one you can actually drive home.

That will change once the 4 goes on sale globally. But right now, you can't even see a future vehicle page for the 4 on any of Polestar's websites except in China. So who knows when it will go on sale.

So you are correct in saying that people don't have any reason to cross-shop Polestar and Porsche. So they're forced to build ""street cred"" with limited editions like the BST to fill the gap.

Having zero business sense myself, IMO they should've stuck with building performance versions of Volvo's lineup until the 3 was ready.

The better quality doesnt justify a 6k premium on a 55k CAD car. Especially for the AWD its a terrible deal because of the range drop.

"Probably should work on that, eh?

Australia used to make cars, but decided to cede production in favor of imports.  Which is a bit ironic because Australia is supplying a lot of the critical raw materials for building EVs.

Australia's population is pretty small at 26 million people, so there are claims that the population wasn't large enough to support a domestic auto industry, but I imagine the real problem was supporting a domestic industry IN ADDITION to allowing imports to flood into the country with minimal pushback.

BTW, I'm not against trade between countries.  I'm against unfair trade, or taking advantage of low wage workers to build products for high wage markets, in a bid to drive up corporate profit margins... which ultimately creates major economic imbalances and hardships.  Companies are using low wage nations where less of the overall product revenue goes to the workers (cycling back into the general economy), and more of the revenue goes to executives and shareholders.  For other nations to compete, they have to cut their own labor costs, which essentially becomes a race to the bottom for the working class.

Buying cars from nations with similar cost of living, with well paid / well treated labor, and with solid environmental / factory regulations means the workers building those products will have the income available to buy products from your nation in return.  That isn't what's happening with China and their underpaid labor force.

And just to reiterate, this isn't the fault of the Chinese workers... it's the fault of the corporations who are using them to drive up their profit margins.",2023-10-03 20:25:13,"recent Tesla MY Owner...rented a Polestar 2...

"So off the top, very nice looking car but the interior usability is a bit lacking. As in, with the vertical display Polestar has found a way to make a UI driven climate control even more aggravating.  
   
His Example,    
  
Tap at the very bottom to bring up the climate part of the UI then tap the fan control button to bring up the fan controls then you can finally adjust the speed of the fan by clicking little bars left and right. Sadly it also tended to lock up and become non responsive. It does support Apple Carplay and Android Auto. Google Assistant is built in      
  
Then comes that cup holder... so the open one is far back on the center console right in front of the arm rest... see where we are going here?  so it means you lose your arm rest and if you want two drinks the center console has to be flipped up but oddly it can rotate over into the rear seats :)   Another bit, it has a transmission tunnel taking up floor space in the rear.  Top vents on dashboard are very badly placed and don't actually blow air towards you - they are right above the screen!  
  
Very comfortable seats and great driving position. can raise and lower seats easily. good mirrors and 360 view when backing compensate for smaller rear view.  great stereo and amazing warm heated steering wheel.

"Wheelbase is not apples to apples since the cayenne does not have a full EV version, nor does the macan.  I would expect those versions to shift out the wheelbase to accommodate battery.

To your point, I am primarily looking at height and trunk space.  The cayenne is clearly higher which gives both greater headroom and more room for storage, driven in part by its need to present a more vertically oriented rear seating and to bring the rear seats a bit closer to the front, both done to maximize the trunk space.  Polestar accounts for its lower height by pushing the rear seats back and allowing for a greater tilt to the rear seating, which increases comfort at the cost of trunk space (guessingnhere because Ive not sat in one).  if I recall, the 3 has like 17 cu.ft while the cayenne has 27.  The Polestar cheats a bit though because 3 of those cubic feet are below the surface of the floor while the cayenne does that all above the floor.  The macan has near identical trunk as the Polestar, again doing it all above floor.

A true comparison is obviously worthless until Porsche releases its EV variants and at that point maybe ill eat my words.  But I have not often seen car makers release smaller models and since both EV and ice will be based on the same overall platform as far as I know, I would expect the cayenne and the macan to grow, probably about 2-3%.  In which case the cayenne will be well above Polestar and the macan will be at around the same size as the 3.",2023-02-09 20:56:44,"New 2023 Polestar 4 readied as sleek Porsche Macan EV rival | Autocar

"Polestar is in a weird spot. Here's what I think as a US-based Volvo owner / enthusiast / follower / armchair analyst. All my opinions.

The 2 is, for all intents and purposes, a rebadged Volvo. It debuted as the Volvo 40.2 concept back in 2016, it was originally planned to have ICE / PHEV / BEV just like the XC40... Then the brand split off in 2017, and the 2 debuted in 2020. And when you compare its price against the XC40 Recharge, it actually is positioned correctly. The 2 starts at $49,900 USD, the XC40 $52,450.

So with that pricing in mind, you'd compare it to the BMW i4, which starts at $52,200. Problem is, it isn't as good as an i4. So then the next step ""down"" is a Tesla Model 3, which starts at $38,990. Then the problem is, the 2 is **way** overpriced. Assuming the 2 would have gotten all three powertrain options as a Volvo, it would have played with the Mercedes C-Class, BMW 3-series, Audi A4, etc... So presumably, once we get an ""A4 e-Tron"" and ""Mercedes EQC sedan"", it will compete with those too.

But then in comes [this Auto Motor und Sport interview](https://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/verkehr/interview-thomas-ingenlath-polestar/) with the CEO laying out that they want to be like Porsche. Better than Porsche even.

So now the 3 comes out, itself a rebodied Volvo EX90. And, strictly on price to performance, it actually is competitive with the Cayenne e-Hybrid. But Polestar has built their reputation so far on cars that people already think are overpriced, and need to be less expensive. So the perception from outsiders is that Polestar is lower-market than they the company internally want to be. And Polestar's own approach is definitively ""anti-Porsche"", with minimal customization / personalization options and a stripped-back delivery and service experience.

Then enters the 4. We should withhold judgment on it for a few more weeks, as that will be when Porsche is revealing the new Macan EV. And we will then know where the 4 stands in terms of price to performance in that way. Meanwhile they are actively in development with the 5 and 6, both publicly targeting the Taycan and 911.

So to answer your question, in terms of where they currently are, Tesla is a thorn in their side - mainly because people think, Tesla can ask this little money for a better EV, why should I buy a Polestar? And because of that, the brand that they **want** to compete with - Porsche - doesn't even come up in conversation.

It should also be noted that Polestar's reliance on China for manufacturing also brings with it a whole bunch of pricing expectations, based on how relatively little money Chinese cars go for over there compared to our market. **Especially** when comparing to Geely's other brands.

"Yeah, I think the biggest issue for the 2 was tariffs in the US. Here in Canada they're a nice middle ground; when fully optioned out the RWD is \~$3k more as the model 3 long range, and the performance mode is around \~$15k less than a fully tricked out BMW i4. Which I think is fair; a bit more than tesla and a fair bit less than BMW

It's a really nice A5/4 series competitor. I think if they released a 3 series competitor and a 2 series (aka the polestarified, lowered EX30) and kept up momentum, they would be doing very well. Especially since the Neue Klasse 3 series is gonna be \~2026, they'd have had a tonne of time to win brand loyalty among people who want a compact sports sedan but EV

Instead, they're doing this Porsche thing, and I just don't get it. They don't even offer Red as a colour for god's sake!

">Distinctive Identity: Polestar's evolution from the Volvo 40.2 concept showcases its commitment to pushing the boundaries of electric vehicle design

The 3 still shares a whole lot with the EX90, especially in the interior. I would even go so far as to say that the 3's interior is differentiated even less from its Volvo counterpart than the 2.

>Performance Credentials: The recent introduction of the Polestar 3...

So if we look at what is the closest thing to a Cayenne EV right now, it's probably the Audi Q8 e-Tron. The Q8 Premium Plus undercuts the base 3 by about $5,000.

The automobile manufacturing industry is one of the largest manufacturing industries (or is it the largest?) on the planet.  If we suddenly stopped producing new cars tomorrow and started transitioning people away automobiles or found ways for most people on the planet to reduce their miles driven, it would rapidly and drastically reduce global manufacturing based emissions.

It's why trying to fix climate issues by building more of the things that are doing most of the damage is a bit silly; we could have done far more to reduce emissions and pollution by pushing more funding to alternative forms of transportation or reduction of transportation demands.  Public transit, bikes, PEVs, carpools, more working from home, 4 day work weeks.

Why do our governments fail to act to support the proper solutions or even just impose a carbon tax that would by its very nature give the lowest emissions solutions the biggest advantage?  Simple:

Money, jobs numbers, and political support/funding by this behemoth industry.

Upsetting the auto industry would cause some economic and political havoc, which would eventually sort itself out over time as workers transition away from the automobile (and supporting) industries and into other fields.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Even if we stick to cars, the world's current use of limited battery resources in long range BEVs is beyond wasteful.

The world produces about 80 million new vehicles per year. I calculated yesterday that if all BEV and PHEV cells produced in 2022 went into only long range BEVs instead (\~80 kWh per vehicle on average), the world would have only produced about 8.2 million BEVs; about 10% of the global new vehicle market.  The remaining cars would be ICEVs.

If a PHEV (\~16 kWh per vehicle on average) uses 1/5th of the cells as a long range BEV, we could have instead produced 41 million PHEVs last year, with the remaining cars being ICEVs.  50% of the global new vehicle market.

If a Hybrid (\~1.5 kWh per vehicle on average) uses 1/10th of the cells per vehicle as a PHEV, then we could have produced 36.5 million PHEVs and 45 million HEVs last year, terminating production on every ICEV on the planet, with 46% of all vehicles being replaced with Plug-in EVs.

Let's say we double global battery cell production in 5 years ... the world will only be capable of producing 16.4 million BEVs, about 20% of the total global vehicle market.  Yet with the same cells, we could produce 82 million PHEVs, entirely replacing all global ICEV production with plug-in vehicles.  That's in 2028...  We wouldn't need HEV production anymore.

From there, as battery production expands, we could begin shifting to BEV production while planning and building a proper universal global charging network.  Of course, we would probably want to concentrate resources on those vehicles with the highest mileage first, namely semi trucks... which would give us a solid start to the charging network planning, and would ensure ample charger demand.

This is what the BEV fanbois don't want anyone to know.  We could have drastically reduced emissions if it wasn't for government incentives designed to pick BEVs as the winner.  Between that and companies like Tesla buying up all the available global battery supply, we could have reduced emissions by far more than we've done today.

People claim Tesla is saving the planet... when they're actually trying to convince the world to use a technology far too early, which is resulting in a slower transition away from fossil fuels.  I don't believe it's because Elon Musk is just a moron and didn't realize it.  I think it's because he's a greedy mofo and he wanted his company to succeed, a company that didn't have the capabilities to develop a PHEV, which would have been a massive undertaking for a startup.  Other startups who have tried, like Fisker, basically just licensed their PHEV tech from companies like GM.",2023-02-08 23:46:50,"Rivian Teams Up With Polestar to Give Us All a Stark Warning

Industrial / commercial includes auto manufacturing (as well as the mining and refining of the enormous amount of raw materials the auto industry uses) and fossil fuel / electricity production.

Some of the largest employers in the world are tied to the auto industry.  It's a bit ironic, but millions upon millions of workers buy cars so that they can travel to work every day to design, build, sell, service, recycle, and fuel cars... which is exactly why our governments have no intention of slowing that industry down.

Well, atmosphere needs about 3 additional grams of water per cubic meter to maintain relative humidity levels if temperature increases from 20 degrees C to 23C. Total mass of earth atmosphere is 5.5 quadrillion tons. At see level the weight of 1 square meter of air is about 1.222 Kg. So, at minimum we have 4.5 10\^19 m3 of atmosphere.

The level raise if happened will definitely spread over 50-100 years. So, likely, shore erosion will have more effect on these people.

>First of all, hot wet air can kill humans pretty quickly, in temperatures that might surprise you. Google ""wet bulb temperature"" and you can read more about this, but basically, beyond a certain point of ambient humidity, sweating doesn't really work (the sweat doesn't evaporate fast enough), and that's how humans shed heat.

Oh! Let me tell you, cold air kills even faster. With increased temperature enormous areas of land in Canada, Russia, USA and maybe Antarctica becomes livable. More then enough to support slow migration from hotter areas over 100 years timeframe. Also with increased absolute humidity we will see decrease of the temperature gradient between night and day in deserts (where increase matters the most)

Well, to really hit a deadly level of acidification, mass extinction etc we need to find a way to release CO2 locked in rocks. As far as I know the marine life was just fine in dinosaur times (temp and CO2 levels were at median back then) when temperature was higher by about 8 degrees.

You dont need to predict. Earth already had different levels of CO2. We know effects.

>This is an interesting claim, but I can't find much to back it up. It's kind of irrelevant though, as we are in no danger whatsoever of going below 200 ppm.

Im talking about decreasing productivity of plants below 200ppm. Also, Im not sure human race have so much control over CO2 levels. Check NOAA CO2 concentration chart through 2020-2021. It didn't even bulge despite virtual stop of private transportation.

Bottom line, yes increasing levels of CO2 carry some challenges, but they are clearly less critical then propaganda pushes by highlighting only negative sides. Clearly there is a number of upsides from milder climate, increased efficiency of farm lands (it will allow to sustain a larger population, which is a huge plus for progress), easier access to new depositions of mineral resources, water availability and so on. All these changes will not happen overnight and allow us to easily mitigate negatives with minimal effort and expense if we stop wasting time and effort on religions attempts to stop waterfall by adding more water to it (bitcoin, private jets, EVs and so on).

P.S. Atmosphere calculations are done at sea level. Yes, it's not accurate, but 10\^14 allows some margin of error.",2023-02-10 21:59:04,"Rivian Teams Up With Polestar to Give Us All a Stark Warning

"Buying used, especially from Hertz, is ONLY about price, yet he didnt provide any insight on dollar value whatsoever! Misleading video.

Still, I agree about the cramped interior. I love the exterior and the size/ shape/ access. This model is the exact one I rented twice from Hertz on two occasions, totaling three weeks, living with and driving it in various conditions. Color is Snow. Really wanted to love it enough to eventually own or lease. Even the Android Automotive was nice along with the direct drivers display. Its a drivers car. But the armrest/ cupholder/ center bulk killed it for me. Maybe the 2024 is less painful.",2024-02-14 16:52:13,"Buying a USED Hertz Polestar 2 EV: Is it worth it? should you buy one?

"People dont understand what is an initial quality survey. Initial quality isnt the overall quality or reliability.

Initial quality is just representative of the number of problems the car encountered during X first years. It isnt about materials and the quality of the plastics used. And Tesla is at the bottom because of their rattles and body panels issues and the service center has to fix post delivery. Ask me how I know. 

We have a fleet of Chevy Bolts and various other EVs at work and the Chevrolet, while not the more luxurious cars made with the best materials, where pretty much troubles free. They didnt go back to the dealer for anything but tires and basic maintenance. So if we did an initial quality survey on our fleet theyd score perfectly.",2023-06-23 00:16:04,"Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, And Polestar Fill Bottom Spots In Initial Quality Study

"Full disclosure. My wife and I have been happy owners of a polestar 2 for just over a year and it has been a great experience so far. I wouldn't call us fanboys/girls but if someone asks, we do often gush over the car. Not to say this is a car or brand for everyone. 

I personally like the car and purchased it for a few big reasons:

- The polestar brand has a very strong environment first ethos.
- The looks is a head turner 
- interior is clean, of quality and not too minimal
- seating position and cockpit 
- software is easy to use and Google powered i.e. Google maps built in, voice assistant etc
- handling is excellent and a hoot to drive
- it's not common and still slightly mysterious 
- hatchback design
- no pressure/ haggling buying experience

We shopped around for a few months before ordering out Polestar. Tried the ioniq5 and mach e but dealers with their markups and tricks annoyed us . Test drove the Tesla model 3 and it was nice but we passed on it as it was more expensive at the time, the interior was a bit too minimal for our taste. Additionally we wanted something different as there are just too many of these where we live. Most importantly though, we just don't want to support their CEO. 

To reiterate, I'm not a fanboy by no means. Ive  test driven a few evs and try to stay on top on all the new and upcoming ones. I think many of them have their strengths and weaknesses. It often comes down to what your personal preferences are. So if you want that bolt because it a great price, go for it. If you want that ioniq5 because its spacious, go for it. If you want that model 3 because of the charging network then go for it. Polestar was it for both my wife and I and we are both very happy with our choice.",2023-04-08 05:37:01,"Polestar Sold Almost 10,000 EVs In The US In 2022, Partly Thanks To The $7,500 Tax Credit

"The rental agency Hertz has a whole fleet of them for really good rates. We were car shopping so I rented a M3, MY, P2, Niro, and Kona. P2 and M3 were about $250-300/week.

My wife and I really really really liked the P2. It has the fit and finish of a 3-series or C-class. Fantastic to drive, quiet, cozy interior. If we could charge at home it would be my first choice. Sadly, when it came to charging we had to rely on a lot of broken, out of service charges in out of the way places.

I was trying to avoid Tesla but their SC network is excellent. The M3 and MY are really similar except in height and storage. All that height really eats in the MY range if you're driving high speed. So never got more than 180 miles from a full charge.

First, Elon is a shithead. The M3 wasn't as polished in the interior as the P2 but the charging worked as expected. Whoever Tesla hired to look after their chargers is doing a fantastic job. We took a road trip and every stop all the chargers were working. So we bought the M3.  The P2 was firmly planted driving but I could not get over my charging options.

The Kona and Niro weren't bad but they were definitely budget. I felt they should be <$30k cars. With the credit on the M3 they were close in price and the 3 was definitely better trimmed.",2023-04-07 00:11:56,"Polestar Sold Almost 10,000 EVs In The US In 2022, Partly Thanks To The $7,500 Tax Credit

"Turo.  


But from your first comment I knew you basically only test drove the loudest EVs. I love how the P2 drives (linear regen + acceleration, no bad habits) but my major complaint about it was the road/wind/outside noise. I spent 10 days with it in Austin from an Enterprise rental and even took it to Circuits of the Americas.  


The BMW i4 was in the same price range as a the Model 3 in 2022 and is vastly quieter, has better suspension, better audio, and a nicer interior. I've owned a Model 3 RWD... it's fine and cheap. At $35K after tax credit it's a good deal but in no way is the 3 is the same class as other luxury EV sedans.",2023-04-07 03:56:43,"Polestar Sold Almost 10,000 EVs In The US In 2022, Partly Thanks To The $7,500 Tax Credit

"In what way do the 3/4/5 etc need to step it up to compete with Porsche? Ive not sat in a Porsche or driven one, but the other Polestars arent drivable yet either so theres no opportunity to compare driving characteristics.

Fit and finish wise, I find Polestars minimalist interior compelling. It is anyway a differentiator from the Taycans many screens; I dont think they need to be 1-1 on interior styling as long as the quality of materials is there. I also like Polestars more apparent focus on sustainability (besides the marketing, base materials in the 2 are vegan, whereas the vegan option on the Taycan costs more).

Granted the Porsche brand is more prestigious, but you cant compete without trying. And hopefully newer buyers wont care as much about the brand name specifically.",2023-06-26 17:08:40,"Polestar wants to sell cars between 100k and 200k, giving us a glimpse of 5 pricing

Its mostly the quality of said materials and general craftsmanship/assembly that will need to be stepped up. Like you said, Porsche has the brand recognition/prestige on its side that Polestar needs to compete with as well.
